EXAMPLES:

--- Example 1 (Standard Case) ---
Input: "A 63 year old female presented for incidentally discovered pulmonary nodules. She denied any respiratory complaints including dyspnea or cough. CT scan showed innumerable diffusely distributed nodules up to 4mm."
Output:
{
  "patient_age": "63",
  "patient_sex": "Female",
  "presenting_symptoms": "Asymptomatic",
  "imaging_findings": "Innumerable and diffusely distributed nodules up to 4mm",
  "treatment": "Observation"
}

--- Example 2 (Complex Histopathology) ---
Input: "Transbronchial biopsies revealed cellular proliferations of meningothelial-like cells associated with venules. IHC was positive for vimentin and EMA, negative for cytokeratin."
Output:
{
  "histopathology": "Minute Pulmonary Meningothelial-like Nodules",
  "immunohistochemistry": "Positive for vimentin/EMA, negative for cytokeratin",
  "diagnostic_method": "Transbronchial biopsy"
}
