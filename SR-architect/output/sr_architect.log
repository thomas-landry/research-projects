It is distinguished by extensive bilateral minute pulmonary meningothelial-like nodules (MPMNs) on imaging, which may seldomly cavitate. These findings are generally incidentally found on imaging due to its asymptomatic course, however, patients may present with dyspnea and/or cough. Cases of DPM are few and pathogenicity associations have not yet been established but some cases display an association with malignancy. Tissue biopsy is strictly necessary for diagnosis given its wide differential diagnosis. A 45-year-old female with a past medical history of hypothyroidism and hyperlipidemia is referred to pulmonary medicine clinics due to abnormal radiologic imaging findings. The patient refers to occasional bouts of dyspnea with no temporal association of years of evolution for which she uses budesonide/formoterol as needed. She is a nonsmoker, without overt exposure or occupational risk factors. A high-resolution chest CT scan revealed innumerable bilateral thin-walled pulmonary cysts with thickened interlobular septa, suggestive of lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels and rheumatoid panel were nondiagnostic, and pulmonary function testing revealed normal FEV1/FVC, moderate air trapping, and increased airway resistance. An open biopsy of the right lung was performed and pathological examination revealed meningothelial nodules, with histologic findings supporting the diagnosis of cavitating diffuse pulmonary meningotheliomatosis. Literature describing DPM is very limited, with only 25 cases documented through 2016. Since the majority of patients are asymptomatic, further research into the pathophysiology and possible etiologies involving the development of DPM and other MPMNs may shed light on their clinical significance and prognosis once symptoms become evident. We aim to raise awareness of MPMNs to improve the identification of clinical patterns and findings related to disease progression as well as establish treatment options. The documentation of these cases is needed to help to establish correlations with other possible pulmonary and extrapulmonary manifestations of this elusive disease which may guide further treatment and prognosis.\n\nThis abstract is funded by: None\n\nAm J Respir Crit Care Med 2023;207:A5796 Internet address: www.atsjournals.org\n\nOnline Abstracts Issue\n"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'extra_body': {'usage': {'include': True}}, 'tools': [{'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'DiscoveryResult', 'description': 'Result from analyzing a single paper.', 'parameters': {'$defs': {'SuggestedField': {'description': 'A field suggested by the discovery agent.', 'properties': {'field_name': {'description': 'Snake_case identifier for this field', 'title': 'Field Name', 'type': 'string'}, 'description': {'description': 'What this field captures', 'title': 'Description', 'type': 'string'}, 'data_type': {'description': 'text, integer, float, boolean, or list_text', 'title': 'Data Type', 'type': 'string'}, 'example_value': {'description': 'Example value from this paper', 'title': 'Example Value', 'type': 'string'}, 'extraction_difficulty': {'description': 'easy, medium, or hard', 'title': 'Extraction Difficulty', 'type': 'string'}, 'section_found': {'description': 'Which section contained this data', 'title': 'Section Found', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['field_name', 'description', 'data_type', 'example_value', 'extraction_difficulty', 'section_found'], 'title': 'SuggestedField', 'type': 'object'}}, 'properties': {'filename': {'title': 'Filename', 'type': 'string'}, 'suggested_fields': {'items': {'$ref': '#/$defs/SuggestedField'}, 'title': 'Suggested Fields', 'type': 'array'}, 'paper_type': {'description': 'case_report, rct, cohort, review, etc.', 'title': 'Paper Type', 'type': 'string'}, 'quality_notes': {'anyOf': [{'type': 'string'}, {'type': 'null'}], 'default': None, 'title': 'Quality Notes'}}, 'required': ['filename', 'paper_type', 'suggested_fields'], 'type': 'object'}}}], 'tool_choice': {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'DiscoveryResult'}}}

Lastly, the diagnosis can be obtained from transbronchial biopsy possibly alleviating the need for surgical lung biopsy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ReFeRences\n\n- Mizutani E, Tsuta K, Maeshima AM, Asamura H, Matsuno Y.

However, _ Vo2max in these patients was probably extremely low because they were not able to exercise. Thus, the improvement in peak _ Vo2 from before to after CF-LVAD may be underestimated.

Because of the small sample size, we cannot make de /uniFB01 nitive conclusions in this population. In addition, although patients received different models of CF-LVAD, peak _ Vo2, percentage predicted _ Vo2max, chronotropic responses, and CRP were not signi /uniFB01 cantly different among patients who were supported with HeartMate II (Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA), HeartWare (HeartWare International Inc, Framingham, MA), or DuraHeart (Terumo Heart Inc, Ann Arbor, MI) devices.\n\nThe presence of diabetes may affect chronotropic response; however, only 2 patients had diabetes, and therefore, we could not control for the effect of diabetes on HR reserve.\n\nFinally, we recognize that only 11 of 15 heart failure patients were able to complete the exercise testing before CF-LVAD. However, _ Vo2max in these patients was probably extremely low because they were not able to exercise. Thus, the improvement in peak _ Vo2 from before to after CF-LVAD may be underestimated. Nevertheless, exercise capacity after CF-LVAD remained impaired.\n\n[Pulmonary meningothelial-like nodules are of donor origin in lung allografts] Minute pulmonary meningothelial-like nodules (MPMNs) are asymptomatic small nodules representing incidental microscopic /uniFB01 ndings in lung specimens. 1,2 The majority of MPMNs are seen in women and in some studies they appear more often in the right lung than the left. 1 Recent studies before CF-LVAD to after CF-LVAD suggests that autonomic responses improved. Our results also suggest that impaired exercise capacity may be associated with in /uniFB02 ammation in CF-LVAD recipients. Future studies should elucidate mechanisms that contribute to chronotropic incompetence and impaired exercise capacity in patients supported with CF-LVADs.\n\n[Heterotopic heart transplantation for elevated pulmonary vascular resistance in the current era: Long-term clinical and hemodynamic outcomes] From July 1995 to August 2007, 18 patients (9 males) with irreversibly high pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) underwent HHT with anastomosis of the donor pulmonary artery to the recipient right atrium.

Because of the small sample size, we cannot make de /uniFB01 nitive conclusions in this population. In addition, although patients received different models of CF-LVAD, peak _ Vo2, percentage predicted _ Vo2max, chronotropic responses, and CRP were not signi /uniFB01 cantly different among patients who were supported with HeartMate II (Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA), HeartWare (HeartWare International Inc, Framingham, MA), or DuraHeart (Terumo Heart Inc, Ann Arbor, MI) devices.\n\nThe presence of diabetes may affect chronotropic response; however, only 2 patients had diabetes, and therefore, we could not control for the effect of diabetes on HR reserve.\n\nFinally, we recognize that only 11 of 15 heart failure patients were able to complete the exercise testing before CF-LVAD. However, _ Vo2max in these patients was probably extremely low because they were not able to exercise. Thus, the improvement in peak _ Vo2 from before to after CF-LVAD may be underestimated. Nevertheless, exercise capacity after CF-LVAD remained impaired.\n\n[Pulmonary meningothelial-like nodules are of donor origin in lung allografts] Minute pulmonary meningothelial-like nodules (MPMNs) are asymptomatic small nodules representing incidental microscopic /uniFB01 ndings in lung specimens. 1,2 The majority of MPMNs are seen in women and in some studies they appear more often in the right lung than the left. 1 Recent studies before CF-LVAD to after CF-LVAD suggests that autonomic responses improved. Our results also suggest that impaired exercise capacity may be associated with in /uniFB02 ammation in CF-LVAD recipients. Future studies should elucidate mechanisms that contribute to chronotropic incompetence and impaired exercise capacity in patients supported with CF-LVADs.\n\n[Heterotopic heart transplantation for elevated pulmonary vascular resistance in the current era: Long-term clinical and hemodynamic outcomes] From July 1995 to August 2007, 18 patients (9 males) with irreversibly high pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) underwent HHT with anastomosis of the donor pulmonary artery to the recipient right atrium.

In addition, although patients received different models of CF-LVAD, peak _ Vo2, percentage predicted _ Vo2max, chronotropic responses, and CRP were not signi /uniFB01 cantly different among patients who were supported with HeartMate II (Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA), HeartWare (HeartWare International Inc, Framingham, MA), or DuraHeart (Terumo Heart Inc, Ann Arbor, MI) devices.\n\nThe presence of diabetes may affect chronotropic response; however, only 2 patients had diabetes, and therefore, we could not control for the effect of diabetes on HR reserve.\n\nFinally, we recognize that only 11 of 15 heart failure patients were able to complete the exercise testing before CF-LVAD. However, _ Vo2max in these patients was probably extremely low because they were not able to exercise. Thus, the improvement in peak _ Vo2 from before to after CF-LVAD may be underestimated. Nevertheless, exercise capacity after CF-LVAD remained impaired.\n\n[Pulmonary meningothelial-like nodules are of donor origin in lung allografts] Minute pulmonary meningothelial-like nodules (MPMNs) are asymptomatic small nodules representing incidental microscopic /uniFB01 ndings in lung specimens. 1,2 The majority of MPMNs are seen in women and in some studies they appear more often in the right lung than the left. 1 Recent studies before CF-LVAD to after CF-LVAD suggests that autonomic responses improved. Our results also suggest that impaired exercise capacity may be associated with in /uniFB02 ammation in CF-LVAD recipients. Future studies should elucidate mechanisms that contribute to chronotropic incompetence and impaired exercise capacity in patients supported with CF-LVADs.\n\n[Heterotopic heart transplantation for elevated pulmonary vascular resistance in the current era: Long-term clinical and hemodynamic outcomes] From July 1995 to August 2007, 18 patients (9 males) with irreversibly high pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) underwent HHT with anastomosis of the donor pulmonary artery to the recipient right atrium.

Here, we present a case of diagnostic dilemma in a patient with a history of malignancy and immunosuppression presenting with diffuse pulmonary meningotheliomatosis (DPM).\n\n[RIDDLE ME THIS: A RARE CASE OF DIFFUSE PULMONARY MENINGIOTHELIOMAS] CASE PRESENTATION: A 61-year-old female with a history of ductal hyperplasia of the breast, common variable immunode /uniFB01 ciency syndrome (CVID), asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, and thyroid follicular cancer was diagnosed with diffuse pulmonary nodules incidentally via CT angiogram chest during inpatient admission for COVID-19 infection. Post-COVID her symptoms improved, but a follow-up CT scan chest 1 year later showed numerous sub 6 mm bilateral centrilobular GGNs and solid pulmonary nodules with mild upper lobe predominance. Labs demonstrated chronic neutropenia with lymphocytosis, positive perinuclear and cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic (PANCA & CANCA) antibody, but negative antinuclear (ANA), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and proteinase 3 (PR3). A thyroid radioactive iodine uptake scan showed expected uptake in the thyroid gland with no abnormal uptake in the lungs, suggesting no evidence of pulmonary metastasis. The patient eventually underwent bronchoscopy with bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL) with transbronchial cryo biopsy of lung nodules, which showed MPMNs with further immunostaining negative for malignancy. The patient's case was discussed with a multidisciplinary ILD clinic, and given the complexity of the case, lack of symptoms, and stability of nodules, a decision was made for close follow-up with serial CT scans.\n\n[RIDDLE ME THIS: A RARE CASE OF DIFFUSE PULMONARY MENINGIOTHELIOMAS] DISCUSSION: In our case, the patient was diagnosed with DPM, which is an exceptionally rare form of widespread MPMs with few cases reported in the literature. Differentials at the time of diagnosis included malignant nodules, atypical infection, autoimmune interstitial lung disease (ILD), and granulomatous lymphocytic interstitial lung disease (GLI-ILD). A systemic approach to lung nodules and transbronchial cryobiopsy led to a clinical diagnosis.\n\n[RIDDLE ME THIS: A RARE CASE OF DIFFUSE PULMONARY MENINGIOTHELIOMAS] CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the importance of lung biopsy for pulmonary nodules of unclear etiology and DPMs as a rare differential. Although MPMNs usually have an indolent course, they may mimic adenocarcinoma in situ, metastasis, or atypical infection, which may lead to misdiagnosis, especially in patients with confounding

Here, we present a case of diagnostic dilemma in a patient with a history of malignancy and immunosuppression presenting with diffuse pulmonary meningotheliomatosis (DPM).\n\n[RIDDLE ME THIS: A RARE CASE OF DIFFUSE PULMONARY MENINGIOTHELIOMAS] CASE PRESENTATION: A 61-year-old female with a history of ductal hyperplasia of the breast, common variable immunode /uniFB01 ciency syndrome (CVID), asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, and thyroid follicular cancer was diagnosed with diffuse pulmonary nodules incidentally via CT angiogram chest during inpatient admission for COVID-19 infection. Post-COVID her symptoms improved, but a follow-up CT scan chest 1 year later showed numerous sub 6 mm bilateral centrilobular GGNs and solid pulmonary nodules with mild upper lobe predominance. Labs demonstrated chronic neutropenia with lymphocytosis, positive perinuclear and cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic (PANCA & CANCA) antibody, but negative antinuclear (ANA), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and proteinase 3 (PR3). A thyroid radioactive iodine uptake scan showed expected uptake in the thyroid gland with no abnormal uptake in the lungs, suggesting no evidence of pulmonary metastasis. The patient eventually underwent bronchoscopy with bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL) with transbronchial cryo biopsy of lung nodules, which showed MPMNs with further immunostaining negative for malignancy. The patient's case was discussed with a multidisciplinary ILD clinic, and given the complexity of the case, lack of symptoms, and stability of nodules, a decision was made for close follow-up with serial CT scans.\n\n[RIDDLE ME THIS: A RARE CASE OF DIFFUSE PULMONARY MENINGIOTHELIOMAS] DISCUSSION: In our case, the patient was diagnosed with DPM, which is an exceptionally rare form of widespread MPMs with few cases reported in the literature. Differentials at the time of diagnosis included malignant nodules, atypical infection, autoimmune interstitial lung disease (ILD), and granulomatous lymphocytic interstitial lung disease (GLI-ILD). A systemic approach to lung nodules and transbronchial cryobiopsy led to a clinical diagnosis.\n\n[RIDDLE ME THIS: A RARE CASE OF DIFFUSE PULMONARY MENINGIOTHELIOMAS] CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the importance of lung biopsy for pulmonary nodules of unclear etiology and DPMs as a rare differential. Although MPMNs usually have an indolent course, they may mimic adenocarcinoma in situ, metastasis, or atypical infection, which may lead to misdiagnosis, especially in patients with confounding

Here, we present a case of diagnostic dilemma in a patient with a history of malignancy and immunosuppression presenting with diffuse pulmonary meningotheliomatosis (DPM).\n\n[RIDDLE ME THIS: A RARE CASE OF DIFFUSE PULMONARY MENINGIOTHELIOMAS] CASE PRESENTATION: A 61-year-old female with a history of ductal hyperplasia of the breast, common variable immunode /uniFB01 ciency syndrome (CVID), asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, and thyroid follicular cancer was diagnosed with diffuse pulmonary nodules incidentally via CT angiogram chest during inpatient admission for COVID-19 infection. Post-COVID her symptoms improved, but a follow-up CT scan chest 1 year later showed numerous sub 6 mm bilateral centrilobular GGNs and solid pulmonary nodules with mild upper lobe predominance. Labs demonstrated chronic neutropenia with lymphocytosis, positive perinuclear and cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic (PANCA & CANCA) antibody, but negative antinuclear (ANA), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and proteinase 3 (PR3). A thyroid radioactive iodine uptake scan showed expected uptake in the thyroid gland with no abnormal uptake in the lungs, suggesting no evidence of pulmonary metastasis. The patient eventually underwent bronchoscopy with bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL) with transbronchial cryo biopsy of lung nodules, which showed MPMNs with further immunostaining negative for malignancy. The patient's case was discussed with a multidisciplinary ILD clinic, and given the complexity of the case, lack of symptoms, and stability of nodules, a decision was made for close follow-up with serial CT scans.\n\n[RIDDLE ME THIS: A RARE CASE OF DIFFUSE PULMONARY MENINGIOTHELIOMAS] DISCUSSION: In our case, the patient was diagnosed with DPM, which is an exceptionally rare form of widespread MPMs with few cases reported in the literature. Differentials at the time of diagnosis included malignant nodules, atypical infection, autoimmune interstitial lung disease (ILD), and granulomatous lymphocytic interstitial lung disease (GLI-ILD). A systemic approach to lung nodules and transbronchial cryobiopsy led to a clinical diagnosis.\n\n[RIDDLE ME THIS: A RARE CASE OF DIFFUSE PULMONARY MENINGIOTHELIOMAS] CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the importance of lung biopsy for pulmonary nodules of unclear etiology and DPMs as a rare differential. Although MPMNs usually have an indolent course, they may mimic adenocarcinoma in situ, metastasis, or atypical infection, which may lead to misdiagnosis, especially in patients with confounding

Here, we present a case of diagnostic dilemma in a patient with a history of malignancy and immunosuppression presenting with diffuse pulmonary meningotheliomatosis (DPM).\n\n[RIDDLE ME THIS: A RARE CASE OF DIFFUSE PULMONARY MENINGIOTHELIOMAS] CASE PRESENTATION: A 61-year-old female with a history of ductal hyperplasia of the breast, common variable immunode /uniFB01 ciency syndrome (CVID), asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, and thyroid follicular cancer was diagnosed with diffuse pulmonary nodules incidentally via CT angiogram chest during inpatient admission for COVID-19 infection. Post-COVID her symptoms improved, but a follow-up CT scan chest 1 year later showed numerous sub 6 mm bilateral centrilobular GGNs and solid pulmonary nodules with mild upper lobe predominance. Labs demonstrated chronic neutropenia with lymphocytosis, positive perinuclear and cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic (PANCA & CANCA) antibody, but negative antinuclear (ANA), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and proteinase 3 (PR3). A thyroid radioactive iodine uptake scan showed expected uptake in the thyroid gland with no abnormal uptake in the lungs, suggesting no evidence of pulmonary metastasis. The patient eventually underwent bronchoscopy with bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL) with transbronchial cryo biopsy of lung nodules, which showed MPMNs with further immunostaining negative for malignancy. The patient's case was discussed with a multidisciplinary ILD clinic, and given the complexity of the case, lack of symptoms, and stability of nodules, a decision was made for close follow-up with serial CT scans.\n\n[RIDDLE ME THIS: A RARE CASE OF DIFFUSE PULMONARY MENINGIOTHELIOMAS] DISCUSSION: In our case, the patient was diagnosed with DPM, which is an exceptionally rare form of widespread MPMs with few cases reported in the literature. Differentials at the time of diagnosis included malignant nodules, atypical infection, autoimmune interstitial lung disease (ILD), and granulomatous lymphocytic interstitial lung disease (GLI-ILD). A systemic approach to lung nodules and transbronchial cryobiopsy led to a clinical diagnosis.\n\n[RIDDLE ME THIS: A RARE CASE OF DIFFUSE PULMONARY MENINGIOTHELIOMAS] CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the importance of lung biopsy for pulmonary nodules of unclear etiology and DPMs as a rare differential. Although MPMNs usually have an indolent course, they may mimic adenocarcinoma in situ, metastasis, or atypical infection, which may lead to misdiagnosis, especially in patients with confounding comorbidities\n\n\n\nFields to extract: case_count, case_count_quote, patient_age, patient_age_quote, patient_sex, patient_sex_quote, presenting_symptoms, presenting_symptoms_quote, diagnostic_method,

Here, we present a case of diagnostic dilemma in a patient with a history of malignancy and immunosuppression presenting with diffuse pulmonary meningotheliomatosis (DPM).\n\n[RIDDLE ME THIS: A RARE CASE OF DIFFUSE PULMONARY MENINGIOTHELIOMAS] CASE PRESENTATION: A 61-year-old female with a history of ductal hyperplasia of the breast, common variable immunode /uniFB01 ciency syndrome (CVID), asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, and thyroid follicular cancer was diagnosed with diffuse pulmonary nodules incidentally via CT angiogram chest during inpatient admission for COVID-19 infection. Post-COVID her symptoms improved, but a follow-up CT scan chest 1 year later showed numerous sub 6 mm bilateral centrilobular GGNs and solid pulmonary nodules with mild upper lobe predominance. Labs demonstrated chronic neutropenia with lymphocytosis, positive perinuclear and cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic (PANCA & CANCA) antibody, but negative antinuclear (ANA), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and proteinase 3 (PR3). A thyroid radioactive iodine uptake scan showed expected uptake in the thyroid gland with no abnormal uptake in the lungs, suggesting no evidence of pulmonary metastasis. The patient eventually underwent bronchoscopy with bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL) with transbronchial cryo biopsy of lung nodules, which showed MPMNs with further immunostaining negative for malignancy. The patient's case was discussed with a multidisciplinary ILD clinic, and given the complexity of the case, lack of symptoms, and stability of nodules, a decision was made for close follow-up with serial CT scans.\n\n[RIDDLE ME THIS: A RARE CASE OF DIFFUSE PULMONARY MENINGIOTHELIOMAS] DISCUSSION: In our case, the patient was diagnosed with DPM, which is an exceptionally rare form of widespread MPMs with few cases reported in the literature. Differentials at the time of diagnosis included malignant nodules, atypical infection, autoimmune interstitial lung disease (ILD), and granulomatous lymphocytic interstitial lung disease (GLI-ILD). A systemic approach to lung nodules and transbronchial cryobiopsy led to a clinical diagnosis.\n\n[RIDDLE ME THIS: A RARE CASE OF DIFFUSE PULMONARY MENINGIOTHELIOMAS] CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the importance of lung biopsy for pulmonary nodules of unclear etiology and DPMs as a rare differential. Although MPMNs usually have an indolent course, they may mimic adenocarcinoma in situ, metastasis, or atypical infection, which may lead to misdiagnosis, especially in patients with confounding

Here, we present a case of diagnostic dilemma in a patient with a history of malignancy and immunosuppression presenting with diffuse pulmonary meningotheliomatosis (DPM).\n\n[RIDDLE ME THIS: A RARE CASE OF DIFFUSE PULMONARY MENINGIOTHELIOMAS] CASE PRESENTATION: A 61-year-old female with a history of ductal hyperplasia of the breast, common variable immunode /uniFB01 ciency syndrome (CVID), asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, and thyroid follicular cancer was diagnosed with diffuse pulmonary nodules incidentally via CT angiogram chest during inpatient admission for COVID-19 infection. Post-COVID her symptoms improved, but a follow-up CT scan chest 1 year later showed numerous sub 6 mm bilateral centrilobular GGNs and solid pulmonary nodules with mild upper lobe predominance. Labs demonstrated chronic neutropenia with lymphocytosis, positive perinuclear and cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic (PANCA & CANCA) antibody, but negative antinuclear (ANA), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and proteinase 3 (PR3). A thyroid radioactive iodine uptake scan showed expected uptake in the thyroid gland with no abnormal uptake in the lungs, suggesting no evidence of pulmonary metastasis. The patient eventually underwent bronchoscopy with bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL) with transbronchial cryo biopsy of lung nodules, which showed MPMNs with further immunostaining negative for malignancy. The patient's case was discussed with a multidisciplinary ILD clinic, and given the complexity of the case, lack of symptoms, and stability of nodules, a decision was made for close follow-up with serial CT scans.\n\n[RIDDLE ME THIS: A RARE CASE OF DIFFUSE PULMONARY MENINGIOTHELIOMAS] DISCUSSION: In our case, the patient was diagnosed with DPM, which is an exceptionally rare form of widespread MPMs with few cases reported in the literature. Differentials at the time of diagnosis included malignant nodules, atypical infection, autoimmune interstitial lung disease (ILD), and granulomatous lymphocytic interstitial lung disease (GLI-ILD). A systemic approach to lung nodules and transbronchial cryobiopsy led to a clinical diagnosis.\n\n[RIDDLE ME THIS: A RARE CASE OF DIFFUSE PULMONARY MENINGIOTHELIOMAS] CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the importance of lung biopsy for pulmonary nodules of unclear etiology and DPMs as a rare differential. Although MPMNs usually have an indolent course, they may mimic adenocarcinoma in situ, metastasis, or atypical infection, which may lead to misdiagnosis, especially in patients with confounding comorbidities\n\n\n\nFields to extract: case_count, case_count_quote, patient_age, patient_age_quote, patient_sex, patient_sex_quote, presenting_symptoms, presenting_symptoms_quote, diagnostic_method,

Here, we present a case of diagnostic dilemma in a patient with a history of malignancy and immunosuppression presenting with diffuse pulmonary meningotheliomatosis (DPM).\n\n[RIDDLE ME THIS: A RARE CASE OF DIFFUSE PULMONARY MENINGIOTHELIOMAS] CASE PRESENTATION: A 61-year-old female with a history of ductal hyperplasia of the breast, common variable immunode /uniFB01 ciency syndrome (CVID), asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, and thyroid follicular cancer was diagnosed with diffuse pulmonary nodules incidentally via CT angiogram chest during inpatient admission for COVID-19 infection. Post-COVID her symptoms improved, but a follow-up CT scan chest 1 year later showed numerous sub 6 mm bilateral centrilobular GGNs and solid pulmonary nodules with mild upper lobe predominance. Labs demonstrated chronic neutropenia with lymphocytosis, positive perinuclear and cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic (PANCA & CANCA) antibody, but negative antinuclear (ANA), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and proteinase 3 (PR3). A thyroid radioactive iodine uptake scan showed expected uptake in the thyroid gland with no abnormal uptake in the lungs, suggesting no evidence of pulmonary metastasis. The patient eventually underwent bronchoscopy with bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL) with transbronchial cryo biopsy of lung nodules, which showed MPMNs with further immunostaining negative for malignancy. The patient's case was discussed with a multidisciplinary ILD clinic, and given the complexity of the case, lack of symptoms, and stability of nodules, a decision was made for close follow-up with serial CT scans.\n\n[RIDDLE ME THIS: A RARE CASE OF DIFFUSE PULMONARY MENINGIOTHELIOMAS] DISCUSSION: In our case, the patient was diagnosed with DPM, which is an exceptionally rare form of widespread MPMs with few cases reported in the literature. Differentials at the time of diagnosis included malignant nodules, atypical infection, autoimmune interstitial lung disease (ILD), and granulomatous lymphocytic interstitial lung disease (GLI-ILD). A systemic approach to lung nodules and transbronchial cryobiopsy led to a clinical diagnosis.\n\n[RIDDLE ME THIS: A RARE CASE OF DIFFUSE PULMONARY MENINGIOTHELIOMAS] CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the importance of lung biopsy for pulmonary nodules of unclear etiology and DPMs as a rare differential. Although MPMNs usually have an indolent course, they may mimic adenocarcinoma in situ, metastasis, or atypical infection, which may lead to misdiagnosis, especially in patients with confounding

Here, we present a case of diagnostic dilemma in a patient with a history of malignancy and immunosuppression presenting with diffuse pulmonary meningotheliomatosis (DPM).\n\n[RIDDLE ME THIS: A RARE CASE OF DIFFUSE PULMONARY MENINGIOTHELIOMAS] CASE PRESENTATION: A 61-year-old female with a history of ductal hyperplasia of the breast, common variable immunode /uniFB01 ciency syndrome (CVID), asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, and thyroid follicular cancer was diagnosed with diffuse pulmonary nodules incidentally via CT angiogram chest during inpatient admission for COVID-19 infection. Post-COVID her symptoms improved, but a follow-up CT scan chest 1 year later showed numerous sub 6 mm bilateral centrilobular GGNs and solid pulmonary nodules with mild upper lobe predominance. Labs demonstrated chronic neutropenia with lymphocytosis, positive perinuclear and cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic (PANCA & CANCA) antibody, but negative antinuclear (ANA), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and proteinase 3 (PR3). A thyroid radioactive iodine uptake scan showed expected uptake in the thyroid gland with no abnormal uptake in the lungs, suggesting no evidence of pulmonary metastasis. The patient eventually underwent bronchoscopy with bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL) with transbronchial cryo biopsy of lung nodules, which showed MPMNs with further immunostaining negative for malignancy. The patient's case was discussed with a multidisciplinary ILD clinic, and given the complexity of the case, lack of symptoms, and stability of nodules, a decision was made for close follow-up with serial CT scans.\n\n[RIDDLE ME THIS: A RARE CASE OF DIFFUSE PULMONARY MENINGIOTHELIOMAS] DISCUSSION: In our case, the patient was diagnosed with DPM, which is an exceptionally rare form of widespread MPMs with few cases reported in the literature. Differentials at the time of diagnosis included malignant nodules, atypical infection, autoimmune interstitial lung disease (ILD), and granulomatous lymphocytic interstitial lung disease (GLI-ILD). A systemic approach to lung nodules and transbronchial cryobiopsy led to a clinical diagnosis.\n\n[RIDDLE ME THIS: A RARE CASE OF DIFFUSE PULMONARY MENINGIOTHELIOMAS] CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the importance of lung biopsy for pulmonary nodules of unclear etiology and DPMs as a rare differential. Although MPMNs usually have an indolent course, they may mimic adenocarcinoma in situ, metastasis, or atypical infection, which may lead to misdiagnosis, especially in patients with confounding comorbidities\n\n\n\nFields to extract: case_count, case_count_quote, patient_age, patient_age_quote, patient_sex, patient_sex_quote, presenting_symptoms, presenting_symptoms_quote, diagnostic_method,

Here, we present a case of diagnostic dilemma in a patient with a history of malignancy and immunosuppression presenting with diffuse pulmonary meningotheliomatosis (DPM).\n\n[RIDDLE ME THIS: A RARE CASE OF DIFFUSE PULMONARY MENINGIOTHELIOMAS] CASE PRESENTATION: A 61-year-old female with a history of ductal hyperplasia of the breast, common variable immunode /uniFB01 ciency syndrome (CVID), asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, and thyroid follicular cancer was diagnosed with diffuse pulmonary nodules incidentally via CT angiogram chest during inpatient admission for COVID-19 infection. Post-COVID her symptoms improved, but a follow-up CT scan chest 1 year later showed numerous sub 6 mm bilateral centrilobular GGNs and solid pulmonary nodules with mild upper lobe predominance. Labs demonstrated chronic neutropenia with lymphocytosis, positive perinuclear and cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic (PANCA & CANCA) antibody, but negative antinuclear (ANA), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and proteinase 3 (PR3). A thyroid radioactive iodine uptake scan showed expected uptake in the thyroid gland with no abnormal uptake in the lungs, suggesting no evidence of pulmonary metastasis. The patient eventually underwent bronchoscopy with bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL) with transbronchial cryo biopsy of lung nodules, which showed MPMNs with further immunostaining negative for malignancy. The patient's case was discussed with a multidisciplinary ILD clinic, and given the complexity of the case, lack of symptoms, and stability of nodules, a decision was made for close follow-up with serial CT scans.\n\n[RIDDLE ME THIS: A RARE CASE OF DIFFUSE PULMONARY MENINGIOTHELIOMAS] DISCUSSION: In our case, the patient was diagnosed with DPM, which is an exceptionally rare form of widespread MPMs with few cases reported in the literature. Differentials at the time of diagnosis included malignant nodules, atypical infection, autoimmune interstitial lung disease (ILD), and granulomatous lymphocytic interstitial lung disease (GLI-ILD). A systemic approach to lung nodules and transbronchial cryobiopsy led to a clinical diagnosis.\n\n[RIDDLE ME THIS: A RARE CASE OF DIFFUSE PULMONARY MENINGIOTHELIOMAS] CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the importance of lung biopsy for pulmonary nodules of unclear etiology and DPMs as a rare differential. Although MPMNs usually have an indolent course, they may mimic adenocarcinoma in situ, metastasis, or atypical infection, which may lead to misdiagnosis, especially in patients with confounding comorbidities\n\n\n\nFields to extract: case_count, case_count_quote, patient_age, patient_age_quote, patient_sex, patient_sex_quote, presenting_symptoms, presenting_symptoms_quote, diagnostic_method,

The small nodules seen elsewhere in the right upper lobe were found to represent minute pulmonary meningotheliallike nodules (MPMNs) (Fig. 1 D). These lesions consisted of cellular proliferations of meningothelial-like cells with round to oval nuclei and indistinct cell borders associated with venules, which expanded the alveolar walls and were accompanied by stromal fibrosis.\n\n[12] [Section: MATERIALS AND METHODS]\nA follow-up chest CT scan 6 months after lobectomy was performed to assess for tumor recurrence and to clarify the presence and the extension of MPMNs in other lung zones. Thin-section CT scans were obtained with 2-mm collimation at 15-mm intervals through the thorax during full inspiration. The scans revealed numerous small nodules of ground-glass attenuation that were thought to represent additional MPMNs (Fig. 1E). These lesions presented in a random distribution but had a tendency to be loca...\n\n[13] [Section: DISCUSSION]\nTo our knowledge, there is only a single description of MPMNs in the English literature (1). Although conventional CT and HRCT were performed in our case, only HRCT could accurately depict the scattered minute areas of ground-glass attenuation. The lesions presented in a random distribution but had a tendency to be located in the periphery of the lung. Microscopic examination of the resected lung demonstrated a greater profusion of nodules than were detected by HRCT. Pathologically, the lesions ...\n\n[14] [Section: DISCUSSION]\nour opinion, the spread of the lesion along the alveolar walls likely results in the ground-glass attenuation seen on HRCT.\n\n[15] [Section: DISCUSSION]\nMeningothelial-like nodules, previously known as minute pulmonary chemodectomas, are relatively rare lesions (2-7). They appear as millimeter-size, interstitial, nodular proliferations of small, oval and spindle-shape cells. The origin and nature of these lesions are unknown. However, recent studies indicate that the cells in these lesions are similar to those of meningiomas (2,7), hence the use of the descriptive term \'meningotheliallike nodules.\'\n\n[16] [Section: DISCUSSION]\nClinically, these nodules are incidental pathologic findings, usually discovered microscopically in resected surgical or autopsy specimens. The incidence of the lesions is estimated to be 0.3% to 4% in unselected autopsy cases (6). Korn et al. (4) described 19 cases, including 14 in females and four in males. Eighty-four percent of all cases to date have occurred in women. Meningotheliallike nodules in the lung have been found in people aged 12 to 91 years, being most common in the seventh decad...\n\n[17] [Section: DISCUSSION]\nMultiple studies attempting to elucidate the origin of meningothelial-like nodules using various immunohistochemical analyses have not clarified the origin and the nature of these lesions (2-4). Gaffey et al. (2) reported that meningothelial-like nodules were immunoreactive for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and vimentin and were negative for cytokeratin, S-100 protein, neuron-specific enolase, and actin. The immunohistochemical features of these pulmonary nodules supported meningothelial dif...\n\n[18] [Section: DISCUSSION]\nMinute pulmonary meningothelial-like nodules are rare, and the HRCT findings are nonspecific. The final diagnosis of persistent small areas of ground-glass attenuation on HRCT requires histopathologic analysis. Although adenocarcinoma of lung may present as a multifocal process, it is important not to assume that groundglass nodules in a lobe separate from the primary tumor in patients with adenocarcinoma reflects multifocal (and therefore unresectable) disease.

They are small (1-3 mm) and often multiple. Pathologically, they represent an interstitial nodular proliferation of small oval or spindle-shape cells arranged in a 'zellenballen' nesting pattern. The function and origin of the cells are unknown. These nodules are associated with specific conditions, including thromboembolism, cardiac disease, and malignancy. We describe a patient with MPMNs and adenocarcinoma of the lung in whom HRCT showed tiny (1-3 mm in diameter) nodules of ground-glass attenuation. Key Words: Minute pulmonary meningothelial-like nodules-High-resolution computed tomography.\n\n[Minute Pulmonary Meningothelial-like Nodules: High-Resolution Computed Tomography and Pathologic Correlations] A2-cm pulmonary nodule was incidentally discovered on screening chest radiographs in a 55-year-old nonsmoking Japanese woman. She was referred to our institution for further evaluation and treatment. Both highresolution CT (HRCT) and routine contrast-enhanced chest CT were obtained (10-mm collimation; WL: -500; WW: 2,000) for staging suspected lung cancer. The nodule was seen in the right upper lobe and showed inhomogeneous enhancement and an irregular border with fine spiculation. The nodule was surrounded by a zone of ground-glass opacity (Fig. 1 A). CT findings were thought to be consistent with a malignant tumor, most likely a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. Laboratory\n\n[Minute Pulmonary Meningothelial-like Nodules: High-Resolution Computed Tomography and Pathologic Correlations] evaluation showed an elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (16.6 ng/mL; normal value: <4.7 ng/mL). Measurements of other tumor-marker levels (CYFRA, NSE, Pro-GRP) were within normal limits.\n\n[MATERIALS AND METHODS] In addition to the right upper lobe nodule, we also found, on HRCT, tiny nodules of ground-glass (1-3 mm in diameter) attenuation in the right upper lobe (Figs. 1 A,B). The findings were considered nonspecific. Differential considerations included atypical adenomatous hyperplasia, bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma, and smoking-related respiratory bronchiolitis. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed with cytologic examination of material obtained from the dominant tumor in the right upper lobe, suggesting malignancy. A right upper lobectomy was performed with the assumption that the patient had stage IA (T1N0M0) lung cancer. The pathologic\n\n[MATERIALS AND METHODS] FIG. 1.

CT (2-mm collimation; WL: -500; WW: 2,000) scan shows a spiculated 2-cm nodule with adjacent ground-glass opacity (arrowheads) in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe, most suggestive of a primary adenocarcinoma. B. CT scan 5-mm cephalad to A shows tiny nodules of ground-glass attenuation (white arrows) in the right upper lobe. C. Low-power photomicrograph of the resected 2-cm nodule shows a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, papillary subtype (H&E, ×10). D.

Follow-up CT scan obtained 12 months after right upper lobectomy. Multiple small nodules (white arrows) are again evident and unchanged from HRCT performed 6 months postoperatively.\n\n[MATERIALS AND METHODS] diagnosis of the main tumor was well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, papillary subtype (Fig. 1 C). The small nodules seen elsewhere in the right upper lobe were found to represent minute pulmonary meningotheliallike nodules (MPMNs) (Fig. 1 D). These lesions consisted of cellular proliferations of meningothelial-like cells with round to oval nuclei and indistinct cell borders associated with venules, which expanded the alveolar walls and were accompanied by stromal fibrosis.\n\n[MATERIALS AND METHODS] A follow-up chest CT scan 6 months after lobectomy was performed to assess for tumor recurrence and to clarify the presence and the extension of MPMNs in other lung zones. Thin-section CT scans were obtained with 2-mm collimation at 15-mm intervals through the thorax during full inspiration. The scans revealed numerous small nodules of ground-glass attenuation that were thought to represent additional MPMNs (Fig. 1E). These lesions presented in a random distribution but had a tendency to be located in the peripheral lung zone. Retrospective review of the initial preoperative CT (10-mm collimation) revealed very tiny nodules corresponding to the nodules seen on the postoperative studies. The lesions showed no change in morphologic characteristics of the ground-glass nodules. Although the lesions seen in the other lobes were not sampled histologically, they were stable for an additional 6-month period.\n\n[DISCUSSION] Clinically, these nodules are incidental pathologic findings, usually discovered microscopically in resected surgical or autopsy specimens. The incidence of the lesions is estimated to be 0.3% to 4% in unselected autopsy cases (6). Korn et al. (4) described 19 cases, including 14 in females and four in males. Eighty-four percent of all cases to date have occurred in women. Meningotheliallike nodules in the lung have been found in people aged 12 to 91 years, being most common in the seventh decade. They are multiple in 30% to 50%. The lesions are associated with thromboembolism in up to 51% of cases, cardiac disease in 48%, and malignancy in 28% (6). A recent study of 357 cases of primary bronchogenic carcinoma found MPMNs in association with 10% of adenocarcinomas and 3.5% of squamous cell carcinomas (5). Minute pulmonary meningothelial-like nodules were seen in our patient with adenocarcinoma of the lung.\n\n[DISCUSSION] Multiple studies attempting to elucidate the origin of meningothelial-like nodules using various immunohistochemical analyses have not clarified the origin and the nature of these lesions (2-4). Gaffey et al. (2) reported that meningothelial-like nodules were immunoreactive for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and vimentin and were negative for cytokeratin, S-100 protein, neuron-specific enolase, and actin. The immunohistochemical features of these pulmonary nodules supported meningothelial differentiation. In contrast, Torikata and Mukai (3) reported positive immunoreactivity for myosin and vimentin in all meningothelial-like nodules.\n\n\n\nFields to extract: case_count, case_count_quote, patient_age,

They are small (1-3 mm) and often multiple. Pathologically, they represent an interstitial nodular proliferation of small oval or spindle-shape cells arranged in a 'zellenballen' nesting pattern. The function and origin of the cells are unknown. These nodules are associated with specific conditions, including thromboembolism, cardiac disease, and malignancy. We describe a patient with MPMNs and adenocarcinoma of the lung in whom HRCT showed tiny (1-3 mm in diameter) nodules of ground-glass attenuation. Key Words: Minute pulmonary meningothelial-like nodules-High-resolution computed tomography.\n\n[Minute Pulmonary Meningothelial-like Nodules: High-Resolution Computed Tomography and Pathologic Correlations] A2-cm pulmonary nodule was incidentally discovered on screening chest radiographs in a 55-year-old nonsmoking Japanese woman. She was referred to our institution for further evaluation and treatment. Both highresolution CT (HRCT) and routine contrast-enhanced chest CT were obtained (10-mm collimation; WL: -500; WW: 2,000) for staging suspected lung cancer. The nodule was seen in the right upper lobe and showed inhomogeneous enhancement and an irregular border with fine spiculation. The nodule was surrounded by a zone of ground-glass opacity (Fig. 1 A). CT findings were thought to be consistent with a malignant tumor, most likely a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. Laboratory\n\n[Minute Pulmonary Meningothelial-like Nodules: High-Resolution Computed Tomography and Pathologic Correlations] evaluation showed an elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (16.6 ng/mL; normal value: <4.7 ng/mL). Measurements of other tumor-marker levels (CYFRA, NSE, Pro-GRP) were within normal limits.\n\n[MATERIALS AND METHODS] In addition to the right upper lobe nodule, we also found, on HRCT, tiny nodules of ground-glass (1-3 mm in diameter) attenuation in the right upper lobe (Figs. 1 A,B). The findings were considered nonspecific. Differential considerations included atypical adenomatous hyperplasia, bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma, and smoking-related respiratory bronchiolitis. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed with cytologic examination of material obtained from the dominant tumor in the right upper lobe, suggesting malignancy. A right upper lobectomy was performed with the assumption that the patient had stage IA (T1N0M0) lung cancer. The pathologic\n\n[MATERIALS AND METHODS] FIG. 1. A 55-year-old woman with MPMNs and adenocarcinoma of the lung. A. CT (2-mm collimation; WL: -500; WW: 2,000) scan shows a spiculated 2-cm nodule with adjacent ground-glass opacity (arrowheads) in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe, most suggestive of a primary adenocarcinoma. B. CT scan 5-mm cephalad to A shows tiny nodules of ground-glass attenuation (white arrows) in the right upper lobe. C. Low-power photomicrograph of the resected 2-cm nodule shows a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, papillary subtype (H&E, ×10). D. Low-power photomicrograph shows cellular proliferations that are associated with a venule (arrow) and expand the alveolar walls with accompanying stromal fibrosis (H&E, ×40). E. Follow-up CT scan obtained 12 months after right upper lobectomy. Multiple small nodules (white arrows) are again evident and unchanged from HRCT performed 6 months postoperatively.\n\n[MATERIALS AND METHODS] diagnosis of the main tumor was well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, papillary subtype (Fig. 1 C). The small nodules seen elsewhere in the right upper lobe were found to represent minute pulmonary meningotheliallike nodules (MPMNs) (Fig. 1 D). These lesions consisted of cellular proliferations of meningothelial-like cells with round to oval nuclei and indistinct cell borders associated with venules, which expanded the alveolar walls and were accompanied by stromal fibrosis.\n\n[MATERIALS AND METHODS] A follow-up chest CT scan 6 months after lobectomy was performed to assess for tumor recurrence and to clarify the presence and the extension of MPMNs in other lung zones. Thin-section CT scans were obtained with 2-mm collimation at 15-mm intervals through the thorax during full inspiration. The scans revealed numerous small nodules of ground-glass attenuation that were thought to represent additional MPMNs (Fig. 1E). These lesions presented in a random distribution but had a tendency to be located in the peripheral lung zone. Retrospective review of the initial preoperative CT (10-mm collimation) revealed very tiny nodules corresponding to the nodules seen on the postoperative studies. The lesions showed no change in morphologic characteristics of the ground-glass nodules. Although the lesions seen in the other lobes were not sampled histologically, they were stable for an additional 6-month period.\n\n[DISCUSSION] Clinically, these nodules are incidental pathologic findings, usually discovered microscopically in resected surgical or autopsy specimens. The incidence of the lesions is estimated to be 0.3% to 4% in unselected autopsy cases (6). Korn et al. (4) described 19 cases, including 14 in females and four in males. Eighty-four percent of all cases to date have occurred in women. Meningotheliallike nodules in the lung have been found in people aged 12 to 91 years, being most common in the seventh decade. They are multiple in 30% to 50%. The lesions are associated with thromboembolism in up to 51% of cases, cardiac disease in 48%, and malignancy in 28% (6). A recent study of 357 cases of primary bronchogenic carcinoma found MPMNs in association with 10% of adenocarcinomas and 3.5% of squamous cell carcinomas (5). Minute pulmonary meningothelial-like nodules were seen in our patient with adenocarcinoma of the lung.\n\n[DISCUSSION] Multiple studies attempting to elucidate the origin of meningothelial-like nodules using various immunohistochemical analyses have not clarified the origin and the nature of these lesions (2-4). Gaffey et al. (2) reported that meningothelial-like nodules were immunoreactive for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and vimentin and were negative for cytokeratin, S-100 protein, neuron-specific enolase, and actin. The immunohistochemical features of these pulmonary nodules supported meningothelial differentiation. In contrast, Torikata and Mukai (3) reported positive immunoreactivity for myosin and vimentin in all meningothelial-like nodules.\n\n\n\nFields to extract: case_count, case_count_quote, patient_age,

They are small (1-3 mm) and often multiple. Pathologically, they represent an interstitial nodular proliferation of small oval or spindle-shape cells arranged in a 'zellenballen' nesting pattern. The function and origin of the cells are unknown. These nodules are associated with specific conditions, including thromboembolism, cardiac disease, and malignancy. We describe a patient with MPMNs and adenocarcinoma of the lung in whom HRCT showed tiny (1-3 mm in diameter) nodules of ground-glass attenuation. Key Words: Minute pulmonary meningothelial-like nodules-High-resolution computed tomography.\n\n[Minute Pulmonary Meningothelial-like Nodules: High-Resolution Computed Tomography and Pathologic Correlations] A2-cm pulmonary nodule was incidentally discovered on screening chest radiographs in a 55-year-old nonsmoking Japanese woman. She was referred to our institution for further evaluation and treatment. Both highresolution CT (HRCT) and routine contrast-enhanced chest CT were obtained (10-mm collimation; WL: -500; WW: 2,000) for staging suspected lung cancer. The nodule was seen in the right upper lobe and showed inhomogeneous enhancement and an irregular border with fine spiculation. The nodule was surrounded by a zone of ground-glass opacity (Fig. 1 A). CT findings were thought to be consistent with a malignant tumor, most likely a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. Laboratory\n\n[Minute Pulmonary Meningothelial-like Nodules: High-Resolution Computed Tomography and Pathologic Correlations] evaluation showed an elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (16.6 ng/mL; normal value: <4.7 ng/mL). Measurements of other tumor-marker levels (CYFRA, NSE, Pro-GRP) were within normal limits.\n\n[MATERIALS AND METHODS] In addition to the right upper lobe nodule, we also found, on HRCT, tiny nodules of ground-glass (1-3 mm in diameter) attenuation in the right upper lobe (Figs. 1 A,B). The findings were considered nonspecific. Differential considerations included atypical adenomatous hyperplasia, bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma, and smoking-related respiratory bronchiolitis. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed with cytologic examination of material obtained from the dominant tumor in the right upper lobe, suggesting malignancy. A right upper lobectomy was performed with the assumption that the patient had stage IA (T1N0M0) lung cancer. The pathologic\n\n[MATERIALS AND METHODS] FIG. 1.

CT (2-mm collimation; WL: -500; WW: 2,000) scan shows a spiculated 2-cm nodule with adjacent ground-glass opacity (arrowheads) in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe, most suggestive of a primary adenocarcinoma. B. CT scan 5-mm cephalad to A shows tiny nodules of ground-glass attenuation (white arrows) in the right upper lobe. C. Low-power photomicrograph of the resected 2-cm nodule shows a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, papillary subtype (H&E, ×10). D. Low-power photomicrograph shows cellular proliferations that are associated with a venule (arrow) and expand the alveolar walls with accompanying stromal fibrosis (H&E, ×40). E. Follow-up CT scan obtained 12 months after right upper lobectomy. Multiple small nodules (white arrows) are again evident and unchanged from HRCT performed 6 months postoperatively.\n\n[MATERIALS AND METHODS] diagnosis of the main tumor was well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, papillary subtype (Fig. 1 C). The small nodules seen elsewhere in the right upper lobe were found to represent minute pulmonary meningotheliallike nodules (MPMNs) (Fig. 1 D). These lesions consisted of cellular proliferations of meningothelial-like cells with round to oval nuclei and indistinct cell borders associated with venules, which expanded the alveolar walls and were accompanied by stromal fibrosis.\n\n[MATERIALS AND METHODS] A follow-up chest CT scan 6 months after lobectomy was performed to assess for tumor recurrence and to clarify the presence and the extension of MPMNs in other lung zones. Thin-section CT scans were obtained with 2-mm collimation at 15-mm intervals through the thorax during full inspiration. The scans revealed numerous small nodules of ground-glass attenuation that were thought to represent additional MPMNs (Fig. 1E). These lesions presented in a random distribution but had a tendency to be located in the peripheral lung zone. Retrospective review of the initial preoperative CT (10-mm collimation) revealed very tiny nodules corresponding to the nodules seen on the postoperative studies. The lesions showed no change in morphologic characteristics of the ground-glass nodules. Although the lesions seen in the other lobes were not sampled histologically, they were stable for an additional 6-month period.\n\n[DISCUSSION] Clinically, these nodules are incidental pathologic findings, usually discovered microscopically in resected surgical or autopsy specimens. The incidence of the lesions is estimated to be 0.3% to 4% in unselected autopsy cases (6). Korn et al. (4) described 19 cases, including 14 in females and four in males. Eighty-four percent of all cases to date have occurred in women. Meningotheliallike nodules in the lung have been found in people aged 12 to 91 years, being most common in the seventh decade. They are multiple in 30% to 50%. The lesions are associated with thromboembolism in up to 51% of cases, cardiac disease in 48%, and malignancy in 28% (6). A recent study of 357 cases of primary bronchogenic carcinoma found MPMNs in association with 10% of adenocarcinomas and 3.5% of squamous cell carcinomas (5). Minute pulmonary meningothelial-like nodules were seen in our patient with adenocarcinoma of the lung.\n\n[DISCUSSION] Multiple studies attempting to elucidate the origin of meningothelial-like nodules using various immunohistochemical analyses have not clarified the origin and the nature of these lesions (2-4). Gaffey et al. (2) reported that meningothelial-like nodules were immunoreactive for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and vimentin and were negative for cytokeratin, S-100 protein, neuron-specific enolase, and actin. The immunohistochemical features of these pulmonary nodules supported meningothelial differentiation. In contrast, Torikata and Mukai (3) reported positive immunoreactivity for myosin and vimentin in all meningothelial-like nodules.\n\n\n\nFields to extract: case_count, case_count_quote, patient_age,

They are small (1-3 mm) and often multiple. Pathologically, they represent an interstitial nodular proliferation of small oval or spindle-shape cells arranged in a 'zellenballen' nesting pattern. The function and origin of the cells are unknown. These nodules are associated with specific conditions, including thromboembolism, cardiac disease, and malignancy. We describe a patient with MPMNs and adenocarcinoma of the lung in whom HRCT showed tiny (1-3 mm in diameter) nodules of ground-glass attenuation. Key Words: Minute pulmonary meningothelial-like nodules-High-resolution computed tomography.\n\n[Minute Pulmonary Meningothelial-like Nodules: High-Resolution Computed Tomography and Pathologic Correlations] A2-cm pulmonary nodule was incidentally discovered on screening chest radiographs in a 55-year-old nonsmoking Japanese woman. She was referred to our institution for further evaluation and treatment. Both highresolution CT (HRCT) and routine contrast-enhanced chest CT were obtained (10-mm collimation; WL: -500; WW: 2,000) for staging suspected lung cancer. The nodule was seen in the right upper lobe and showed inhomogeneous enhancement and an irregular border with fine spiculation. The nodule was surrounded by a zone of ground-glass opacity (Fig. 1 A). CT findings were thought to be consistent with a malignant tumor, most likely a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. Laboratory\n\n[Minute Pulmonary Meningothelial-like Nodules: High-Resolution Computed Tomography and Pathologic Correlations] evaluation showed an elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (16.6 ng/mL; normal value: <4.7 ng/mL). Measurements of other tumor-marker levels (CYFRA, NSE, Pro-GRP) were within normal limits.\n\n[MATERIALS AND METHODS] In addition to the right upper lobe nodule, we also found, on HRCT, tiny nodules of ground-glass (1-3 mm in diameter) attenuation in the right upper lobe (Figs. 1 A,B). The findings were considered nonspecific. Differential considerations included atypical adenomatous hyperplasia, bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma, and smoking-related respiratory bronchiolitis. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed with cytologic examination of material obtained from the dominant tumor in the right upper lobe, suggesting malignancy. A right upper lobectomy was performed with the assumption that the patient had stage IA (T1N0M0) lung cancer. The pathologic\n\n[MATERIALS AND METHODS] FIG. 1.

CT (2-mm collimation; WL: -500; WW: 2,000) scan shows a spiculated 2-cm nodule with adjacent ground-glass opacity (arrowheads) in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe, most suggestive of a primary adenocarcinoma. B. CT scan 5-mm cephalad to A shows tiny nodules of ground-glass attenuation (white arrows) in the right upper lobe. C. Low-power photomicrograph of the resected 2-cm nodule shows a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, papillary subtype (H&E, ×10). D. Low-power photomicrograph shows cellular proliferations that are associated with a venule (arrow) and expand the alveolar walls with accompanying stromal fibrosis (H&E, ×40). E. Follow-up CT scan obtained 12 months after right upper lobectomy. Multiple small nodules (white arrows) are again evident and unchanged from HRCT performed 6 months postoperatively.\n\n[MATERIALS AND METHODS] diagnosis of the main tumor was well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, papillary subtype (Fig. 1 C). The small nodules seen elsewhere in the right upper lobe were found to represent minute pulmonary meningotheliallike nodules (MPMNs) (Fig. 1 D). These lesions consisted of cellular proliferations of meningothelial-like cells with round to oval nuclei and indistinct cell borders associated with venules, which expanded the alveolar walls and were accompanied by stromal fibrosis.\n\n[MATERIALS AND METHODS] A follow-up chest CT scan 6 months after lobectomy was performed to assess for tumor recurrence and to clarify the presence and the extension of MPMNs in other lung zones. Thin-section CT scans were obtained with 2-mm collimation at 15-mm intervals through the thorax during full inspiration. The scans revealed numerous small nodules of ground-glass attenuation that were thought to represent additional MPMNs (Fig. 1E). These lesions presented in a random distribution but had a tendency to be located in the peripheral lung zone. Retrospective review of the initial preoperative CT (10-mm collimation) revealed very tiny nodules corresponding to the nodules seen on the postoperative studies. The lesions showed no change in morphologic characteristics of the ground-glass nodules. Although the lesions seen in the other lobes were not sampled histologically, they were stable for an additional 6-month period.\n\n[DISCUSSION] Clinically, these nodules are incidental pathologic findings, usually discovered microscopically in resected surgical or autopsy specimens. The incidence of the lesions is estimated to be 0.3% to 4% in unselected autopsy cases (6). Korn et al. (4) described 19 cases, including 14 in females and four in males. Eighty-four percent of all cases to date have occurred in women. Meningotheliallike nodules in the lung have been found in people aged 12 to 91 years, being most common in the seventh decade. They are multiple in 30% to 50%. The lesions are associated with thromboembolism in up to 51% of cases, cardiac disease in 48%, and malignancy in 28% (6). A recent study of 357 cases of primary bronchogenic carcinoma found MPMNs in association with 10% of adenocarcinomas and 3.5% of squamous cell carcinomas (5). Minute pulmonary meningothelial-like nodules were seen in our patient with adenocarcinoma of the lung.\n\n[DISCUSSION] Multiple studies attempting to elucidate the origin of meningothelial-like nodules using various immunohistochemical analyses have not clarified the origin and the nature of these lesions (2-4). Gaffey et al. (2) reported that meningothelial-like nodules were immunoreactive for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and vimentin and were negative for cytokeratin, S-100 protein, neuron-specific enolase, and actin. The immunohistochemical features of these pulmonary nodules supported meningothelial differentiation. In contrast, Torikata and Mukai (3) reported positive immunoreactivity for myosin and vimentin in all meningothelial-like nodules.\n\n\n\nFields to extract: case_count, case_count_quote, patient_age,

They are small (1-3 mm) and often multiple. Pathologically, they represent an interstitial nodular proliferation of small oval or spindle-shape cells arranged in a 'zellenballen' nesting pattern. The function and origin of the cells are unknown. These nodules are associated with specific conditions, including thromboembolism, cardiac disease, and malignancy. We describe a patient with MPMNs and adenocarcinoma of the lung in whom HRCT showed tiny (1-3 mm in diameter) nodules of ground-glass attenuation. Key Words: Minute pulmonary meningothelial-like nodules-High-resolution computed tomography.\n\n[Minute Pulmonary Meningothelial-like Nodules: High-Resolution Computed Tomography and Pathologic Correlations] A2-cm pulmonary nodule was incidentally discovered on screening chest radiographs in a 55-year-old nonsmoking Japanese woman. She was referred to our institution for further evaluation and treatment. Both highresolution CT (HRCT) and routine contrast-enhanced chest CT were obtained (10-mm collimation; WL: -500; WW: 2,000) for staging suspected lung cancer. The nodule was seen in the right upper lobe and showed inhomogeneous enhancement and an irregular border with fine spiculation. The nodule was surrounded by a zone of ground-glass opacity (Fig. 1 A). CT findings were thought to be consistent with a malignant tumor, most likely a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. Laboratory\n\n[Minute Pulmonary Meningothelial-like Nodules: High-Resolution Computed Tomography and Pathologic Correlations] evaluation showed an elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (16.6 ng/mL; normal value: <4.7 ng/mL). Measurements of other tumor-marker levels (CYFRA, NSE, Pro-GRP) were within normal limits.\n\n[MATERIALS AND METHODS] In addition to the right upper lobe nodule, we also found, on HRCT, tiny nodules of ground-glass (1-3 mm in diameter) attenuation in the right upper lobe (Figs. 1 A,B). The findings were considered nonspecific. Differential considerations included atypical adenomatous hyperplasia, bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma, and smoking-related respiratory bronchiolitis. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed with cytologic examination of material obtained from the dominant tumor in the right upper lobe, suggesting malignancy. A right upper lobectomy was performed with the assumption that the patient had stage IA (T1N0M0) lung cancer. The pathologic\n\n[MATERIALS AND METHODS] FIG. 1.

CT (2-mm collimation; WL: -500; WW: 2,000) scan shows a spiculated 2-cm nodule with adjacent ground-glass opacity (arrowheads) in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe, most suggestive of a primary adenocarcinoma. B. CT scan 5-mm cephalad to A shows tiny nodules of ground-glass attenuation (white arrows) in the right upper lobe. C. Low-power photomicrograph of the resected 2-cm nodule shows a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, papillary subtype (H&E, ×10). D. Low-power photomicrograph shows cellular proliferations that are associated with a venule (arrow) and expand the alveolar walls with accompanying stromal fibrosis (H&E, ×40). E. Follow-up CT scan obtained 12 months after right upper lobectomy. Multiple small nodules (white arrows) are again evident and unchanged from HRCT performed 6 months postoperatively.\n\n[MATERIALS AND METHODS] diagnosis of the main tumor was well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, papillary subtype (Fig. 1 C). The small nodules seen elsewhere in the right upper lobe were found to represent minute pulmonary meningotheliallike nodules (MPMNs) (Fig. 1 D). These lesions consisted of cellular proliferations of meningothelial-like cells with round to oval nuclei and indistinct cell borders associated with venules, which expanded the alveolar walls and were accompanied by stromal fibrosis.\n\n[MATERIALS AND METHODS] A follow-up chest CT scan 6 months after lobectomy was performed to assess for tumor recurrence and to clarify the presence and the extension of MPMNs in other lung zones. Thin-section CT scans were obtained with 2-mm collimation at 15-mm intervals through the thorax during full inspiration. The scans revealed numerous small nodules of ground-glass attenuation that were thought to represent additional MPMNs (Fig. 1E). These lesions presented in a random distribution but had a tendency to be located in the peripheral lung zone. Retrospective review of the initial preoperative CT (10-mm collimation) revealed very tiny nodules corresponding to the nodules seen on the postoperative studies. The lesions showed no change in morphologic characteristics of the ground-glass nodules. Although the lesions seen in the other lobes were not sampled histologically, they were stable for an additional 6-month period.\n\n[DISCUSSION] Clinically, these nodules are incidental pathologic findings, usually discovered microscopically in resected surgical or autopsy specimens. The incidence of the lesions is estimated to be 0.3% to 4% in unselected autopsy cases (6). Korn et al. (4) described 19 cases, including 14 in females and four in males. Eighty-four percent of all cases to date have occurred in women. Meningotheliallike nodules in the lung have been found in people aged 12 to 91 years, being most common in the seventh decade. They are multiple in 30% to 50%. The lesions are associated with thromboembolism in up to 51% of cases, cardiac disease in 48%, and malignancy in 28% (6). A recent study of 357 cases of primary bronchogenic carcinoma found MPMNs in association with 10% of adenocarcinomas and 3.5% of squamous cell carcinomas (5). Minute pulmonary meningothelial-like nodules were seen in our patient with adenocarcinoma of the lung.\n\n[DISCUSSION] Multiple studies attempting to elucidate the origin of meningothelial-like nodules using various immunohistochemical analyses have not clarified the origin and the nature of these lesions (2-4). Gaffey et al. (2) reported that meningothelial-like nodules were immunoreactive for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and vimentin and were negative for cytokeratin, S-100 protein, neuron-specific enolase, and actin. The immunohistochemical features of these pulmonary nodules supported meningothelial differentiation. In contrast, Torikata and Mukai (3) reported positive immunoreactivity for myosin and vimentin in all meningothelial-like nodules.\n\n\n\nFields to extract: case_count, case_count_quote, patient_age,

A right upper lobectomy was performed with the assumption that the patient had stage IA (T1N0M0) lung cancer. The pathologic\n\n[MATERIALS AND METHODS] FIG. 1. A 55-year-old woman with MPMNs and adenocarcinoma of the lung. A. CT (2-mm collimation; WL: -500; WW: 2,000) scan shows a spiculated 2-cm nodule with adjacent ground-glass opacity (arrowheads) in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe, most suggestive of a primary adenocarcinoma. B. CT scan 5-mm cephalad to A shows tiny nodules of ground-glass attenuation (white arrows) in the right upper lobe. C. Low-power photomicrograph of the resected 2-cm nodule shows a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, papillary subtype (H&E, ×10). D. Low-power photomicrograph shows cellular proliferations that are associated with a venule (arrow) and expand the alveolar walls with accompanying stromal fibrosis (H&E, ×40). E. Follow-up CT scan obtained 12 months after right upper lobectomy. Multiple small nodules (white arrows) are again evident and unchanged from HRCT performed 6 months postoperatively.\n\n[MATERIALS AND METHODS] diagnosis of the main tumor was well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, papillary subtype (Fig. 1 C). The small nodules seen elsewhere in the right upper lobe were found to represent minute pulmonary meningotheliallike nodules (MPMNs) (Fig. 1 D). These lesions consisted of cellular proliferations of meningothelial-like cells with round to oval nuclei and indistinct cell borders associated with venules, which expanded the alveolar walls and were accompanied by stromal fibrosis.\n\n[MATERIALS AND METHODS] A follow-up chest CT scan 6 months after lobectomy was performed to assess for tumor recurrence and to clarify the presence and the extension of MPMNs in other lung zones. Thin-section CT scans were obtained with 2-mm collimation at 15-mm intervals through the thorax during full inspiration. The scans revealed numerous small nodules of ground-glass attenuation that were thought to represent additional MPMNs (Fig. 1E). These lesions presented in a random distribution but had a tendency to be located in the peripheral lung zone. Retrospective review of the initial preoperative CT (10-mm collimation) revealed very tiny nodules corresponding to the nodules seen on the postoperative studies. The lesions showed no change in morphologic characteristics of the ground-glass nodules. Although the lesions seen in the other lobes were not sampled histologically, they were stable for an additional 6-month period.\n\n[DISCUSSION] Clinically, these nodules are incidental pathologic findings, usually discovered microscopically in resected surgical or autopsy specimens. The incidence of the lesions is estimated to be 0.3% to 4% in unselected autopsy cases (6). Korn et al. (4) described 19 cases, including 14 in females and four in males. Eighty-four percent of all cases to date have occurred in women. Meningotheliallike nodules in the lung have been found in people aged 12 to 91 years, being most common in the seventh decade. They are multiple in 30% to 50%. The lesions are associated with thromboembolism in up to 51% of cases, cardiac disease in 48%, and malignancy in 28% (6). A recent study of 357 cases of primary bronchogenic carcinoma found MPMNs in association with 10% of adenocarcinomas and 3.5% of squamous cell carcinomas (5). Minute pulmonary meningothelial-like nodules were seen in our patient with adenocarcinoma of the lung.\n\n[DISCUSSION] Multiple studies attempting to elucidate the origin of meningothelial-like nodules using various immunohistochemical analyses have not clarified the origin and the nature of these lesions (2-4). Gaffey et al. (2) reported that meningothelial-like nodules were immunoreactive for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and vimentin and were negative for cytokeratin, S-100 protein, neuron-specific enolase, and actin. The immunohistochemical features of these pulmonary nodules supported meningothelial differentiation. In contrast, Torikata and Mukai (3) reported positive immunoreactivity for myosin and vimentin in all meningothelial-like nodules.\n\n\n\nFields to extract: case_count, case_count_quote, patient_age,

Saa 1 , S. Assaf 2 ;  1 Internal Medicine, The University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, United States,  2 Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, The University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, United States.\n\n## Corresponding author's email: lsaa@salud.unm.edu\n\nIntroduction Minute pulmonary meningothelial-like nodules (MPMNs) were first described in 1960 and thought to be pulmonary chemodectomas. Further research showed their resemblance with meningothelial cells. MPMNs are typically found incidentally and in the majority of the time, they are solitary nodules, with fewer reported incidences of multiple lesions named diffuse pulmonary meningotheliomatosis. It is more common in women in their fifth to sixth decade of life. It is typically an asymptomatic disease, although there have been a few reports of patients who presented with shortness of breath and cough. Although most solitary nodules can be removed, little is known about treatment options for multiple lesions. Case Description A 51-year-old female, former smoker, with a past medical history of transient ischemic attack, hypertension, and childhood asthma on albuterol presented to the clinic for worsening dyspnea since December 2019. Her dyspnea originally started with cold symptoms including a cough; although her cough improved, her dyspnea persisted. Spirometry was consistent with a restrictive lung disease. A CT of the chest was obtained, which showed diffuse subcentimetric nodularities in random distribution. Fungal serology and connective tissue disease panels were negative. Quantiferon testing was negative. She subsequently underwent a bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial lung biopsies (TBBX). Cultures were negative for bacterial, mycobacterial and fungal growth. Pathology was negative for malignancy. Since she had ongoing dyspnea with an unclear etiology of her numerous bilateral pulmonary nodules, she underwent a right thoracotomy with multiple lung biopsies. Pathology was significant for nested cells with immunostaining positive for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), CD56, and progesterone receptor. The morphology and immunophenotype supported the diagnosis of diffuse pulmonary meningotheliomatosis. Discussion Diffuse pulmonary meningotheliomatosis is a rare diagnosis, and the etiology is still unclear, with the leading theory being that it originates from meningothelial cells. Patients have been found to have single lesions, usually found incidentally, as well as multiple lesions. It is currently unclear if these are a reactive proliferation, a neoplastic process, or a transition point between the two. This case illustrates the need for consideration of diffuse pulmonary meningotheliomatosis in the differential diagnosis for patients who present with dyspnea and are found to have multiple pulmonary nodules on imaging.

Saa 1 , S. Assaf 2 ;  1 Internal Medicine, The University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, United States,  2 Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, The University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, United States.\n\n## Corresponding author's email: lsaa@salud.unm.edu\n\nIntroduction Minute pulmonary meningothelial-like nodules (MPMNs) were first described in 1960 and thought to be pulmonary chemodectomas. Further research showed their resemblance with meningothelial cells. MPMNs are typically found incidentally and in the majority of the time, they are solitary nodules, with fewer reported incidences of multiple lesions named diffuse pulmonary meningotheliomatosis. It is more common in women in their fifth to sixth decade of life. It is typically an asymptomatic disease, although there have been a few reports of patients who presented with shortness of breath and cough. Although most solitary nodules can be removed, little is known about treatment options for multiple lesions. Case Description A 51-year-old female, former smoker, with a past medical history of transient ischemic attack, hypertension, and childhood asthma on albuterol presented to the clinic for worsening dyspnea since December 2019. Her dyspnea originally started with cold symptoms including a cough; although her cough improved, her dyspnea persisted. Spirometry was consistent with a restrictive lung disease. A CT of the chest was obtained, which showed diffuse subcentimetric nodularities in random distribution. Fungal serology and connective tissue disease panels were negative. Quantiferon testing was negative. She subsequently underwent a bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial lung biopsies (TBBX). Cultures were negative for bacterial, mycobacterial and fungal growth. Pathology was negative for malignancy. Since she had ongoing dyspnea with an unclear etiology of her numerous bilateral pulmonary nodules, she underwent a right thoracotomy with multiple lung biopsies. Pathology was significant for nested cells with immunostaining positive for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), CD56, and progesterone receptor. The morphology and immunophenotype supported the diagnosis of diffuse pulmonary meningotheliomatosis. Discussion Diffuse pulmonary meningotheliomatosis is a rare diagnosis, and the etiology is still unclear, with the leading theory being that it originates from meningothelial cells. Patients have been found to have single lesions, usually found incidentally, as well as multiple lesions. It is currently unclear if these are a reactive proliferation, a neoplastic process, or a transition point between the two. This case illustrates the need for consideration of diffuse pulmonary meningotheliomatosis in the differential diagnosis for patients who present with dyspnea and are found to have multiple pulmonary nodules on imaging.

PPMs and MPMNs are usually discovered incidentally during physical examination or lung surgeries performed for other indications. In recent years, pulmonary nodules have become more commonly, due to the popularization of regular physical examinations and the development of m...\n\n[35] [Section: CLINICAL FEATURES OF PPM AND MPMN]\nMeningiomas are common tumors of the nervous system originating from meningothelial cells of the arachnoid layer, often occurring in the intracranial or spinal canal. Meningiomas occurring in tissues and organs not covered by the meninges are termed ectopic meningiomas. PPM is defined as a primary meningioma in the lung tissue[3] and is classified as a rare condition under the category of lung tumors of ectopic tissues according to the World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Thoracic T...\n\n[36] [Section: CLINICAL FEATURES OF PPM AND MPMN]\nPatients with PPMs and MPMNs usually present with no obvious symptoms, other than some atypical respiratory symptoms, although this can depend on tumor size, location, and accompanying diseases[5-7]. PPMs are usually found through imaging examinations[5,8]. Patients with PPMs are mainly middle-aged or older women[1,7,9]. The vast majority of  PPMs are benign, well-circumscribed and solitary, with a favorable prognosis[5,10-12]. Therefore, the major therapeutic method for PPM is surgery, such as ...\n\n[37] [Section: IMAGING FEATURES OF PPM AND MPMN]\nRadiologically, PPMs most commonly appear in the form of pulmonary nodules[5]. However, the visual features of PPM nodules are not universal, for example, they can appear either as a solitary nodule or in clusters[7,15]. The distribution of nodules is frequently subpleural (less than 1 cm away from the visceral pleura), whereas others are intrapulmonary (greater than 1 cm away from the visceral pleura), with these two presentations accounting for 89.1% and 10.9% of cases, respectively[18]. The e...\n\n[38] [Section: IMAGING FEATURES OF PPM AND MPMN]\nPPM nodules usually manifest as a round homogeneous mass with well-demarcated borders on imaging examinations [5,7,13,18].

However, the visual features of PPM nodules are not universal, for example, they can appear either as a solitary nodule or in clusters[7,15]. The distribution of nodules is frequently subpleural (less than 1 cm away from the visceral pleura), whereas others are intrapulmonary (greater than 1 cm away from the visceral pleura), with these two presentations accounting for 89.1% and 10.9% of cases, respectively[18].

Tao et al [32] previously reported that MPMNs showed strong and di...\n\n[48] [Section: PATHOGENESIS OF PPM AND MPMN]\nThe incidence of ectopic meningioma is very rare (2%) and can be found in various anatomical sites such as the head and neck region, and specifically in the sinonasal tract, ear and temporal bone, and scalp[33]. However, meningiomas originating from the lungs are even more rare. Although the pathogenesis of PPM and MPMN remains unclear, it is generally believed that ectopic meningioma is derived from pluripotential subpleural mesenchymal cells or heterotopic embryonic rests of arachnoid cells[3]...\n\n[49] [Section: PATHOGENESIS OF PPM AND MPMN]\nPPM and MPMN are more common in females. Further, as both PPM and MPMN cells express PR, the occurrence of these tumors may be related to PR activity. Moreover, PR develop from normal meningeal epithelial cells and the expression in meningiomas has been well confirmed, with results indicating the potential presence of lung meningeal epithelioid cells in normal lung tissues[2].\n\n\nFor each chunk, provide:\n- index: the chunk number\n- relevant: 1 if it likely contains extractable data, 0 if not\n- reason: brief explanation (max 10 words)\n\nReturn the correct JSON response within a ```json codeblock. not the JSON_SCHEMA'}], 'model': 'llama3.1:8b-instruct-q8_0'}, 'extra_json': {'usage': {'include': True}}}
