Post-COVID her symptoms improved, but a follow-up CT scan chest 1 year later showed numerous sub 6 mm bilateral centrilobular GGNs and solid pulmonary nodules with mild upper lobe predominance. Labs demonstrated chronic neutropenia with lymphocytosis, positive perinuclear and cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic (PANCA & CANCA) antibody, but negative antinuclear (ANA), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and proteinase 3 (PR3). A thyroid radioactive iodine uptake scan showed expected uptake in the thyroid gland with no abnormal uptake in the lungs, suggesting no evidence of pulmonary metastasis. The patient eventually underwent bronchoscopy with bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL) with transbronchial cryo biopsy of lung nodules, which showed MPMNs with further immunostaining negative for malignancy. The patient's case was discussed with a multidisciplinary ILD clinic, and given the complexity of the case, lack of symptoms, and stability of nodules, a decision was made for close follow-up with serial CT scans.",
