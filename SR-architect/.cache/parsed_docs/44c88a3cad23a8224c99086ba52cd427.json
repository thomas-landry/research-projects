      "text": "This case describes a woman in her 50s who presented with recurrent lower respiratory tract infections. She was an ex-  smoker and had worked on a livestock farm for many years. Chest radiograph and CT of the chest revealed multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules. Bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial biopsy did not confirm a unifying diagnosis and thus, surgical biopsy was pursued. Video-  assisted thoracoscopic surgical guided biopsy of the right upper, middle and lower lobes demonstrated intraparenchymal minute nodules, consisting of bland epithelioid cells without any evidence of malignancy. The nodules stained positive for neural cell adhesion molecule (CD56) and progesterone receptor with weakly positive epithelial membrane antigen and smooth muscle actin. The combination of this characteristic staining pattern, the diffuse subcentimetre nature of the nodules and this clinical presentation fit with a diagnosis of the ultra-  rare pulmonary disease, diffuse pulmonary meningotheliomatosis (DPM). This case highlights a rare cause of bilateral diffuse pulmonary nodules and thus, the breadth of differential diagnoses that need to be considered when approaching such a finding. Careful history-  taking and thorough workup is often needed, typically requiring input from multiple specialties. DPM, while rare, should not be overlooked when considering the underlying cause of this presentation, especially in female patients. This case reiterates how common clinical presentations can unveil rare conditions and the contributions of physicians, pathologists and radiologists in the diagnosis and management of these complex diseases.",

The  patient  we present  had  a  history  of  recurrent  infections  which  led  us  to consider an infectious cause or a predisposing underlying small airways disease,  especially  in  the  context  of  a  notable  eosinophilia.  However,  the  negative  microbiology  on  BAL  did  not support infectious aetiology.

Rare lung diseases such a pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis (PLCH) and multifocal micronodular pneumocyte hyperplasia as seen in patients with tuberous sclerosis were also considered. PLCH is more common but not exclusively seen in male patients with a smoking history and the history was not suggestive of an underlying diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis. 4",

Mutations of the TP53 gene on chromosome 17, which has a very low incidence in meningiomas, accounted for the highest rate of LOH in MPMN-  omatosis (19.04%) and were also seen in single MPMN (10%). 12 13 This led the authors to conclude that differing genetic pathways were at play, casting further mystery over the exact origin and nature of MPMNs.",

After my scan, I was very nervous about going ahead with surgery, but I also felt adamant to get to the cause of my issues. When I spoke to my specialist doctor after the results of the surgery, I felt conflicted. On one hand, I was relieved it wasn't an anything immediately life threatening. However, I have to admit I felt a little disappointed it wasn't something that could be solved overnight, or with medication. I currently feel better, however I still have an occasional cough, perhaps not as frequent as before. I feel a little wheezy at times, but I am not short of breath and I am able to carry on doing my normal activities. I have avoided livestock since, but I still need to stop using my e-  cigarette.

She was an ex-  smoker and had worked on a livestock farm for many years. Chest radiograph and CT of the chest revealed multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules. Bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial biopsy did not confirm a unifying diagnosis and thus, surgical biopsy was pursued. Video-  assisted thoracoscopic surgical guided biopsy of the right upper, middle and lower lobes demonstrated intraparenchymal minute nodules, consisting of bland epithelioid cells without any evidence of malignancy. The nodules stained positive for neural cell adhesion molecule (CD56) and progesterone receptor with weakly positive epithelial membrane antigen and smooth muscle actin. The combination of this characteristic staining pattern, the diffuse subcentimetre nature of the nodules and this clinical presentation fit with a diagnosis of the ultra-  rare pulmonary disease, diffuse pulmonary meningotheliomatosis (DPM). This case highlights a rare cause of bilateral diffuse pulmonary nodules and thus, the breadth of differential diagnoses that need to be considered when approaching such a finding. Careful history-  taking and thorough workup is often needed, typically requiring input from multiple specialties. DPM, while rare, should not be overlooked when considering the underlying cause of this presentation, especially in female patients. This case reiterates how common clinical presentations can unveil rare conditions and the contributions of physicians, pathologists and radiologists in the diagnosis and management of these complex diseases.\n\n## BACKGROUND\n\nDiffuse pulmonary nodules are a common finding on  chest  imaging.  The  potential  list  of  causes  is exhaustive  and  range  from  benign  to  infectious to malignant disease processes. Despite radiological advances, histopathological sampling is often needed to confirm the diagnosis with confidence and rule out more sinister causes. Given the morbidity  of  potential  causes  of  bilateral  pulmonary  nodules  such  as  malignancy  and  progressive interstitial lung diseases (ILDs), it is pertinent that this diagnosis is achieved in a timely manner.\n\nDiffuse pulmonary meningotheliomatosis (DPM) is a rare diffuse pulmonary disease, which is more common in females and is usually diagnosed in the 5th-7th  decades  of  life.  It  is  characterised  by  the presence of multiple bilateral (100 \u00b5 m to a few mm) pulmonary nodules on chest imaging and nests of moderately sized elongated cells with oval nuclei,\n\n1\n\n6\n\nfinely granular chromatin, inconspicuous nucleoli, and abundant granular and eosinophilic cytoplasm on  histopathological  assessment. 1 While  DPM  is rare, it's general appearance on radiology; bilateral diffuse pulmonary nodules, is seen more commonly by physicians. 2 3\n\n## CASE PRESENTATION\n\nA  female  patient  in  her  50s  was  referred  to  the specialist respiratory outpatient clinic by her primary care physician with recurrent lower respiratory  chest  infections.  She  reported  a  chronic cough for 4  months, productive of moderate volumes  of  green  sputum.  There  were  no  triggers  and  no  diurnal  variation.  She  reported  longstanding dyspnoea on walking up hills only. She had generalised malaise but denied haemoptysis, weight loss and night sweats. She had no recent travel. She received four courses of antibiotics per annum for the last 5  years but had never been hospitalised.\n\nOther  medical  history  was  notable  for  juvenile arthritis, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidaemia and depression. Medications included mirtazapine, rosuvastatin,  sertraline,  fluticasone  furoate  nasal spray,  brinzolamide  eye-  drops  and  levothyroxine. She had been started on salbutamol and budesonide/ formoterol inhalers in the community for possible asthma as a cause for her symptoms. She had a 50 pack-  year smoking history having stopped 6 years prior.  She  continued  to  use  e-  cigarettes  daily.  She worked on a livestock farm all her life with significant exposure to poultry and goats. She had no relevant family history of note.\n\nOn examination, oxygen saturations were 98% on room air and she was not in respiratory distress. There was no evidence of finger clubbing or  connective  tissue  disease.  Respiratory  examination  revealed  normal  vesicular  breath  sounds throughout.\n\n## INVESTIGATIONS\n\nPosteroanterior chest radiograph showed numerous small  nodules,  mainly  in  the  upper  lobes  bilaterally (figure 1). These had been identified on prior chest  radiographs  dating  back  3  years  and  were reported as stable. Pulmonary function tests identified  a  forced  expiratory  volume  in  1  s  (FEV1) of  1.96  L  (85%  of  predicted  value),  forced  vital capacity (FVC) of 2.65  L (98% of predicted value), an FEV1/FVC ratio of 74% and a diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) of 76% of predicted value.\n\nLaboratory  workup  was  pursued  and  revealed normal inflammatory markers. Antinuclear antibody\n\nFigure 1 Chest radiograph demonstrates multiple tiny pulmonary parenchymal nodules throughout both lung fields but with an upper lobe predominance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntitre was positive at 400  IU/mL in a homogeneous pattern. The remainder of the connective tissue disease screen was normal. Peak  eosinophil  count  was  0.4  (range:  0.02-0.5\u00d710 9 /L)  with the total IgE at 100 kU/L (range: 0-100 kU/L). IgE house dust mite, dog dander and grass mix were all negative with IgE to cat dander mildly elevated at 0.42 kU/L (range: 0.0-0.35 kU). High-  resolution  CT  of  the  chest  revealed  background  fibrotic ILD with predominantly subpleural changes, affecting the lung apices and right lower lobe. One 6  mm left upper lobe nodule was identified and two 5  mm nodules in the right upper lobe. There was no mediastinal adenopathy but several small, calcified granulomata were noted bilaterally (figures 2 and 3).\n\nMicrobiological testing on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from the right middle and upper lobes were negative for bacteria and fungi.  BAL  cell  differential  demonstrated  75%  macrophages, 18% lymphocytes, 2% neutrophils and 5% eosinophils. Transbronchial  biopsy  revealed  findings  suggestive  of  respiratory bronchiolitis with prominent aggregates of intra-  alveolar foamy histiocytes and background anthracotic pigmentation. The case was discussed at the respiratory multidisciplinary team (MDT) meeting where it was agreed that respiratory bronchiolitis was unlikely to explain all the radiological findings. Thus, surgical sampling was recommended. Video-  assisted thoracoscopic surgical  (VATS)  guided  wedge  resection  was  performed  with biopsies taken from the right upper, middle and lower lobe.\n\n## DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\n\nThe differential diagnosis for pulmonary nodules is broad and includes  infections,  sarcoidosis,  hypersensitivity  pneumonitis, small airways disease, malignancy and other rare lung diseases. The importance of a detailed history and clinical examination to  guide  investigation  cannot  be  overlooked.  The  patient  we present  had  a  history  of  recurrent  infections  which  led  us  to consider an infectious cause or a predisposing underlying small airways disease,  especially  in  the  context  of  a  notable  eosinophilia.  However,  the  negative  microbiology  on  BAL  did  not support infectious aetiology. Total IgE titres were normal, with only a mildly elevated cat dander-  specific IgE, and there was a preserved  FEV1/FVC  ratio  on  spirometry,  all  going  against  a diagnosis  such  as  asthma.  There  was  no  radiological  evidence of  mosaic  attenuation  or  air  trapping,  and  the  distribution  of nodules  was  not  typical  for  hypersensitivity  pneumonitis  or sarcoidosis, but remained in the differential diagnosis. Primary lung  cancer  and  metastatic  disease  were  considered  in  light of  the  chronicity  of  symptoms  and  tobacco history.  Rare lung diseases such a pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis (PLCH) and multifocal micronodular pneumocyte hyperplasia as seen in patients with tuberous sclerosis were also considered. PLCH is more common but not exclusively seen in male patients with a smoking history and the history was not suggestive of an underlying diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis. 4\n\nVATS surgical  biopsy  of  the  right  upper,  middle  and  lower lobes was pursued to investigate for malignancy and determine the underlying cause. Histopathology revealed small intraparenchymal minute nodules of bland epithelioid  cells  without  any evidence of malignancy. The nodules stained positive for neural cell adhesion molecule (CD56) and progesterone receptor, and epithelial  membrane  antigen  (EMA)  and  smooth  muscle  actin (SMA) were weakly positive. Staining was negative for TTF-  1, napsin A, chromogranin, HMB45, S100 and desmin. In addition, there were tobacco-  related changes of emphysema, small airway  disease  with  bronchiectasis,  peribronchial  metaplasia, peribronchial inflammation and respiratory bronchiolitis.\n\nTTF-  1, napsin A and chromogranin staining ruled out primary lung  malignancy  and  the  lack  of  HMB45,  S100  and  desmin staining were reassuring from a metastatic disease perspective. While  progesterone  receptor  staining,  often  seen  in  rare  lung diseases,  was  weakly  positive,  HMB45  negativity  would  go against  diagnoses  such  as  lymphangioleoimyomatosis. Furthermore in pulmonary benign metastasising leiomyoma, the nodules usually stain strongly positive for SMA and desmin. As seen in this case, strong expression of EMA and vimentin, and negative S-  100  and  SMA  staining  in  the  presence  of  small  intraparenchymal minute nodules of bland epithelioid cells is in keeping with Minute Pulmonary Meningothelial like Nodules (MPMN). CD56 staining has been reported in the literature in more recent cases of MPMN also. 5 The case was discussed at MDT where it was agreed the nodular change identified on both radiology and histology were in keeping with a unifying diagnosis of DPM. The background fibrotic ILD is likely smoking related.\n\n## TREATMENT\n\nThere are no specific treatments or recommendations available on how best to approach treatment in the case of DPM. This is likely due to the rarity of this disease and also the benign disease course.\n\n## OUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP\n\nSince diagnosis, she has been followed up closely in the specialist respiratory outpatient clinic. Her symptoms remain stable with an ongoing productive cough. She continues to use an e-  cigarette with no further exposure to poultry or livestock. Spirometry has remained stable over a 4-  year period with a drop in DLCO from 76%  to  67.6%  predicted  value.  Using  the  Fleischner  Society pulmonary  nodule  guidelines,  repeat  CT  thorax  at  a  2-  year interval showed stable appearances of previously described lung nodules.\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nThis  case  describes  DPM  as  the  cause  of  bilateral  pulmonary nodules  in  a  female  patient  in  her  50s.  While  the  reported\n\nA\n\nB\n\nFigure 2 Cross-  sectional slices from the high-  resolution CT of the chest of our patient demonstrating two distinct nodules in the right upper lobe (see arrows) (A, B).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nincidence  of  DPM  is  exceedingly  rare,  there  is  a  growing consensus on the clinical significance it may play.\n\nMPMNs were first discovered in  1960  by  Korn et  al ,  who described  their  appearance  as  distinctive  perivascular  cellular proliferations  suggestive  of  chemodectomas  in  cytology  and arrangement  and  arranged  in  clusters  along  the  intra-  alveolar septae,  findings  supported  by  Zak  and  Chabes's  observations in 1963. 6 7 Chemodectoma is the term given to a carotid body tumour consisting of non-  chromaffin reacting paraganglionic or glomic tissue. 8 Glomic tissue deposition outside of the cervical chain and carotid body distribution has been reported for many years but typically in close proximity to the pulmonary artery and ascending aorta. 7 These  were  the  first  cases  to  describe  a chemodectoma within the lung parenchyma, namely a 'pulmonary  chemodectoma',  although  no  association  with  clinical presentation  was  made  at  this  time  but  a  female  preponderance was noted. The nomenclature was subsequently changed to  'so-  called  chemodectomas'  when  neurosecretory  granules were  not  detected  by  electron  microscopy. 9 The  proposed neuroendocrine descent came further into question when Gaffey et al found evidence of meningothelial derivation on immunohistochemistry with reactivity with vimentin and EMA and lack of reactivity with cytokeratin, actin, S-  100 and neuron-  specific enolase. 10 11 In 1988, based off these histopathological observations, the name MPMN was coined. 12\n\nWhile most cases of MPMN are picked up incidentally, small case series and case reports have described patients with multiple MPMNs. The condition was initially called chemodectomatosis and  later  changed  to  minute  pulmonary  meningothelial-  like nodulomatosis  or  MPMN-  atosis. 7  12 The  relationship  between the  asymptomatic  and  symptomatic  disease  was  unclear  but led many to question if a neoplastic process might be at play in those who develop MPMN-  atosis. With this in mind, Ionescu et  al explored  if  there  were  genotypic  and  molecular  overlap between MPMN and meningiomas, a well-  studied and understood benign meningothelial cell neoplastic disease. The surgical lung specimens were collected from 16 patients and yielded 31 MPMNs. All of these cases were investigated for the presence of\n\nFigure 3 Coronal sections from the high-  resolution CT of the chest of our patient demonstrating interstitial fibrosis in the right lower lobe (A)\u00a0and the lung apices (B).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n6\n\n## Case report\n\nloss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 20 microsatellite markers from 11 chromosomal loci (1p, 3p, 5q, 9p, 9q, 10q, 14q, 17p, 18q, 19q and 22q). The sporadic presence of LOH was reported in all 12 cases of patients with an isolated MPMN, confirming the reactive  nature  of  MPMN. 12 Greater  genetic  instability  with LOH seen in at least one chromosomal locus per nodule were found  in  patients  with  MPMN-  omatosis,  suggesting  that  this condition might represent a transition between a reactive and neoplastic process. 22q mutations were identified in both cases of meningiomas and MPMN but were significantly more prevalent in meningiomas (60% vs 10%). Mutations of the TP53 gene on chromosome 17, which has a very low incidence in meningiomas, accounted for the highest rate of LOH in MPMN-  omatosis (19.04%) and were also seen in single MPMN (10%). 12 13 This led the authors to conclude that differing genetic pathways were at play, casting further mystery over the exact origin and nature of MPMNs.\n\nA possible link with thromboembolic disease was described in 2009. Mukhopadhyay et  al systematically  examined  over  500 surgical specimens for evidence of MPMNs and found an incidence of 13.8%. MPMNs were detected in a staggering 42% of surgical lung biopsies from cases of thromboembolic disease or infarcts and 26% of patients with Respiratory bronchiolitis-  ILD/ desquamative  interstitial  pneumonia.  Interestingly,  MPMNs were not identified in any of the 92 paediatric lung specimens, suggesting  that  these  findings  are  not  congenital  in  nature. 14 Other case series  have  found  a  higher  incidence  of  history  of previous or active malignancy in cases where MPMNs are identified. 1 15 16\n\nThe  term  DPM  was  introduced  by  Suster  and  Moran  in 2007 after they encountered five patients with dyspnoea, bilateral interstitial infiltrates on chest imaging and diffuse bilateral MPMN on histopathological  assessment.  The  diffuse  bilateral involvement  of  the  lung  parenchyma  with  MPMN  led  to  the appropriate terming DPM. 15 Classically, patients with DPM are asymptomatic (up to 60% of cases) and it is usually an incidental finding on imaging, at autopsy or in a surgical resection for an unrelated cause. When symptomatic, patients will typically report dyspnoea and cough. 1 High-  resolution CT of the chest is usually required  to  further  characterise  the  pulmonary  nodules  with most patients  undergoing  surgical  lung  biopsy  for  a  definitive diagnosis. 1 Diagnosis  by  transbronchial  biopsy  and  cryobiopsy have also been described. 1 5 17 18 The treatment and prognosis of this condition is not well understood or documented in scientific research. Over the last four decades, there have been a number of case reports and case series describing patients with DPM but there remains a noticeable void in any large database or studies. This is surprising given the high incidence of MPMNs in 13.8% of the surgical lung biopsies performed by Mukhopadhyay et al in 2009.\n\nIn summary, the significance of MPMNs alone and MPMNs in  the  context  of  DPM is  unclear.  The  pathophysiology, clinical course and prognosis of DPM is undetermined. In the fastpaced world that we currently live in, where resourceful use of medical resources is pertinent, defining the significance of conditions such as DPM should be essential. If clarified as a benign or reactive condition, physicians would have the confidence to reduce  the  need  for  imaging  or  further  surgical  intervention. However, given the possible link of DPM as a transitional state to  a  neoplastic  process,  the  presentation  of  multiple  pulmonary nodules poses a clinical dilemma. Once a malignant cause is ruled out, should MPMNs be surveyed and followed and if so, for how long? If DPM is a precursor of malignancy, further surveillance  and  or  intervention  will  be  required,  however, currently further research is needed to clarify the clinical significance of DPM.\n\n## Patient's perspective\n\nFrom a young age, I always felt I had weak lungs. Over the last few years, I noticed an increase in my attendance to my local doctor for chest infections, which concerned me. I was a heavy smoker and I continue to use my e-  cigarette, so I was worried about something serious. After my scan, I was very nervous about going ahead with surgery, but I also felt adamant to get to the cause of my issues. When I spoke to my specialist doctor after the results of the surgery, I felt conflicted. On one hand, I was relieved it wasn't an anything immediately life threatening. However, I have to admit I felt a little disappointed it wasn't something that could be solved overnight, or with medication. I currently feel better, however I still have an occasional cough, perhaps not as frequent as before. I feel a little wheezy at times, but I am not short of breath and I am able to carry on doing my normal activities. I have avoided livestock since, but I still need to stop using my e-  cigarette. I am glad I still have follow up with the specialist service.\n\n## Learning points\n\n- Despite advances in diagnostic techniques, a detailed history and clinical examination is still fundamental to establishing an accurate differential diagnosis.\n- In patients with bilateral pulmonary nodules, diffuse pulmonary meningotheliomatosis should be considered in the differential diagnoses, particularly in women.\n- It is pertinent to maintain a broad differential even for the most common clinical presentations, to avoid missing a rare cause.\n\nContributors OH and MO'C wrote the manuscript and gathered clinical information.
