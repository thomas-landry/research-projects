Furthermore, no relationship was found between the length of CF-LVAD support and peak \\_ Vo2 and percentage predicted \\_ Vo2max.\n\nOur study has limitations. Because of the small sample size, we cannot make de /uniFB01 nitive conclusions in this population. In addition, although patients received different models of CF-LVAD, peak \\_ Vo2, percentage predicted \\_ Vo2max, chronotropic responses, and CRP were not signi /uniFB01 cantly different among patients who were supported with HeartMate II (Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA), HeartWare (HeartWare International Inc, Framingham, MA), or DuraHeart (Terumo Heart Inc, Ann Arbor, MI) devices.\n\nAnother limitation is that the length of support varied among the CF-LVAD recipients; however, the length of support did not have an effect on exercise capacity. In addition, \u03b2 -blockers may affect exercise capacity and chronotropic responses, and BMI may be related to in /uniFB02 ammation and exercise capacity. However, this study found no differences between patients who were and were not taking \u03b2 -blockers, and BMI did not correlate with exercise capacity or CRP levels. In terms of the small proportion of patients taking \u03b2 -blockers at baseline, clinicians at our institution titrate RAAS inhibitors /uniFB01 rst, followed by \u03b2 -blockers. Accordingly, with longer CF-LVAD support, a higher proportion of patients may use \u03b2 -blockers.\n\nThe presence of diabetes may affect chronotropic response; however, only 2 patients had diabetes, and therefore, we could not control for the effect of diabetes on HR reserve.\n\nFinally, we recognize that only 11 of 15 heart failure patients were able to complete the exercise testing before CF-LVAD. However, \\_ Vo2max in these patients was probably extremely low because they were not able to exercise. Thus, the improvement in peak \\_ Vo2 from before to after CF-LVAD may be underestimated. Nevertheless, exercise capacity after CF-LVAD remained impaired.\n\nIn conclusion, although not normalized, chronotropic responses were higher after CF-LVAD implantation compared with before CF-LVAD implantation. In our study, chronotropic responses were below 80%, con /uniFB01 rming that chronotropic incompetence persisted after CF-LVAD implantation. Because HR recovery was o 12 beats at 1 minute after exercise cessation, the increase in HR recovery from\n\n## Pulmonary meningothelial-like nodules are of donor origin in lung allografts\n\nAlyssa Luvison, BS, Carol Sherer, MS, and Samuel A.

Historically, MPMNs were thought to have an oxygen-monitoring function as chemoreceptors, but subsequent electron-microscopic studies failed to show neuroendocrine differentiation and instead showed ultrastructural features suggesting\n\nFigure 1 In this case, a female recipient received a male allograft. At left, one can identify the whorls of epithelioid cells within the interstitium characteristic of MPMNs.

On the basis of immunohistochemical stains, primarily positivity for epithelial membrane antigen and vimentin, and negative studies for cytokeratin, actin, S100 protein, CD34, chromogranin and synaptophysin, Gaffey et al suggested labeling these lesions \"minute pulmonary meningothelial-like nodules\" because of their similarity to meningiomas. 1\n\nAs noted in a prior correspondence in this journal, MPMNs can be seen as an incidental /uniFB01 nding in surveillance transbronchial biopsies performed on lung allograft recipients. 3 Agozzino et al 3 believed, based on clinical and radiographic /uniFB01 ndings, that MPMNs were probably of donor origin. Although their study relied exclusively on clinical information, no further studies of MPMNs in lung allograft recipients have been performed to further document their observations. In this brief correspondence we support their impression by utilizing XY chromosome in situ hybridization in gender-mismatched patients who were noted to have MPMNs in surveillance transbronchial biopsies of their lung allografts.\n\nThe patient /uniFB01 les of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center-Presbyterian Hospital were reviewed for all lung allografts where MPMNs were noted at transbronchial biopsy and there was a recipient and donor gender mismatch. Although 6 patients ful /uniFB01 lled the criteria, only 2 of them had suf /uniFB01 cient formalin/uniFB01 xed paraf /uniFB01 n embedded tissue to perform chimerism assays. Dual-color /uniFB02 uorescence in situ hybridization for the sex chromosomes was performed using an X/Y direct labeled probe (Abbott Molecular, Des Plaines, IL), as described elsewhere. 4,5 Positive and negative controls for the XY chromosomes were performed using lung tissues from non-allograft male and female recipients: 2 orange signals (X chromosomes) in female cells, and an orange and a green signal (X and Y\n\nchromosomes) in male cells. Ninety-seven percent of cells had an appropriate signal constellation in these controls. Areas of MPMN on hematoxylin -eosin sections were matched to hybridized slides and were evaluated using a series of /uniFB01 lters that enabled viewing of only the X or Y chromosomes (single bandpass /uniFB01 lters), as well as both the X and Y chromosomes (dual bandpass /uniFB01 lters). Digital images were taken of every diagnostic cell. Immunostains showed the MPMN cells to stain for epithelial membrane antigen and vimentin and to not express CD68, a histiocytic marker.\n\nTwo cases comprised the study group. One woman (Case 1) received a male lung allograft for idiopathic pulmonary /uniFB01 brosis and had MPMN identi /uniFB01 ed at 1.1 years post-transplant; the other (Case 2) was a male recipient of a female lung allograft for severe smoking-induced bronchiolitis obliterans and had MPMN identi /uniFB01 ed 10.5 years post-transplant. In each case, the cells comprising the meningothelial-like nodules showed the donor phenotype (Case 1: 7 cells; Case 2: 40 cells) (Figure 1).\n\nThis limited study of 2 cases of lung allografts containing MPMNs demonstrates that the cells comprising the proliferation of these benign nodules are of a donor rather than recipient origin. This is of interest in that there is a continuing evolution of understanding with regard to nonalloreactive pathologic processes and stem cell colorizations occurring in the allograft lung. These processes have demonstrated, for example, that the histiocytes in the granulomas of recurrent sarcoid are of recipient origin, the proliferating lymphocytes in post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders are most commonly of recipient origin, and the proliferating cells in recurrent lymphangioleiomyomatosis are of recipient etiology. MPMNs are incidental /uniFB01 ndings and, in our assessment of 4 4,800 transbronchial\n\nbiopsies performed, only 42 cases of MPMNs were identi /uniFB01 ed in allograft lungs. Because of their small size and the need to recut paraf /uniFB01 n blocks to perform chimerism studies, only 2 of our 6 gender-mismatched recipients were available for study, but they provided convincing evidence that this cellular proliferation arises from the donated graft. 4 This observation con /uniFB01 rms earlier studies published in this journal that utilized primarily clinical data to arrive at this conclusion.\n\n## Disclosure statement\n\nThe authors have no con /uniFB02 icts of interest to disclose.\n\n## Heterotopic heart transplantation for elevated pulmonary vascular resistance in the current era: Long-term clinical and hemodynamic outcomes\n\nAngelina Vassileva, MD, Orazio Valsecchi, MD, Roberta Sebastiani, MD, Alessandra Fontana, MD, and Amando Gamba, MD\n\nFrom the Diagnostica e Interventistica Cardiovascolare, Ospedali Riuniti di Bergamo, Bergamo, Italy.\n\nThe International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) Registry shows that approximately 20% of early deaths after heart transplantation is attributable to right heart failure. 1,2 Heterotopic heart transplantation (HHT), with anastomosis of the donor pulmonary artery to the recipient right atrium, is a potential solution to avoid this complication. This report updates our prior results with the use of this technique. 3\n\nFrom July 1995 to August 2007, 18 patients (9 males) with irreversibly high pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) underwent HHT with anastomosis of the donor pulmonary artery to the recipient right atrium. All patients signed the informed consent for the treatment according to the local Ethics Committee.\n\nThe indication for HHT was based on the following parameters obtained in the presence of adequate pulmonary vasodilatation:\n\n1. pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) 4 6 units/m 2 ,\n2. transpulmonary gradient 4 15 mm Hg, or\n3. pulmonary systolic pressure 4 60 mm Hg.\n\nAll patients had a degree of pulmonary hypertension to satisfy at least two of the given criteria (Table 1). The etiologic indication for HHT was restrictive cardiomyopathy in 8, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy in 3, and ischemic cardiomyopathy in 2. In addition, 1 patient each presented with cardiomyopathy arising after anthracycline chemotherapy; severe left ventricular dysfunction after resection of a sub-aortic membrane, corrected transposition of great arteries with right isomerism; ventricular septal defect (with a left-to-right shunt partially reduced by a mild pulmonary\n\n## References\n\n1.
