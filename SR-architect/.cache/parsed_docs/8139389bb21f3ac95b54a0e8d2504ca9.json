      "text": "MPMNs were first described as ' chemodectomas ' by Korn et al. in 1960  based  on  their  morphology  and  close  relationship  with  blood vessels  [3].  Later,  immunohistochemical,  ultrastructural  and  fluorescence in situ hybridization studies showed no evidence of neuroendocrine  differentiation  but  rather  found  these  to  be  meningothelial  in origin  [4 -7].  MPMNs  are  benign  often  asymptomatic  and  incidental lesions that are seen on autopsies or surgical lung resections performed for unrelated reasons [8]. MPMNs have been described in the 12 -92 years of age range but are most common in the sixth to seventh decade. A female predominance has been reported with female to male ratio ranging from 1.8:1 to as high as 9:1 [1,3,5,9]. Though often presenting as solitary nodules, MPMNs can rarely be multiple and confined to a lobe or may be distributed diffusely in which case they are called ' DPM ' , a term coined by Suster in 2007 [2]. DPM is usually asymptomatic as well, but can present with respiratory symptoms and mild restrictive lung disease on pulmonary function tests, as seen in our case. The exact etiology  remains  uncertain,  despite  various  studies  reporting  potential associations  with  thromboembolism, smoking-related interstitial lung disease and neoplasm [5,8,10]. Clonal and mutational studies support a reactive rather than neoplastic process for the solitary MPMNs [5,11]. When discovered on imaging studies either incidentally or due to clinical  symptoms,  definitive  diagnosis  requires  surgical  lung  biopsy  or rarely transbronchial biopsy [12 -14]. Management is conservative with surveillance imaging. In the presented case, the patient has remained stable in the 6-month follow-up after VATS biopsy.",

However, all these entities pertain to the airways or vessels located  in  the  center  of  the  secondary  pulmonary  lobule  and  hence typically  present  with  centrilobular  distribution  in  contrast  to  the random distribution seen in this case. Additionally, imaging findings of air trapping and upper lung predilection in HP and RB-ILD respectively are not seen in this case. Lack of history of smoking, antigen exposure and clinical features of infection also make RB-ILD, HP and infectious processes unlikely. For randomly distributed nodules, differential diagnostic  considerations  include  metastatic  disease,  and  infectious  processes (miliary pattern). Metastatic disease is excluded as this is usually encountered in the context of a known underlying primary malignancy and the nodules on imaging are discrete and well defined rather than ground glass in attenuation.

Few authors have also reported nodules with predominantly centrilobular [2] or peripheral predominance [2]. Zonal predominance is variable and has been described as upper lobe [9,15] lower lobe (Fig. 1B) [16] or no zonal predominance [1]. Rarely, some DPM nodules show central cavitation [1], which could be confused for infection inflammatory processes or granulomatous disease.

Introduction\n\nMinute  pulmonary  meningothelial-like  nodules  (MPMN)  are  a benign entity, often found incidentally in pathologic specimens following  surgical  resection  or  at  autopsy  [1].  MPMNs  are  mostly asymptomatic  and  often  found  as  a  single  nodule.  Although  less frequently reported, MPMNs can be multiple, termed diffuse pulmonary meningotheliomatosis (DPM) manifesting as diffuse micro-nodules in a random distribution [2]. This imaging appearance can mimic malignant or infectious lesions on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). To broaden the understanding of this entity, we present a case of DPM confirmed  by  surgical  biopsy  and  review  existing  literature  with emphasis on the radiologic findings.\n\n## 2. Case report\n\nAn 80-year-old woman presented to pulmonary clinic with dry cough and progressive dyspnea over 10 months. The patient denied fever or chest pain.

Since this imaging appearance can be confusing and can mimic other disease processes, it is important to have an organized approach. In this specific case, the distribution and appearance of nodules, their presence for a prolonged period as well as the clinical context were clues to the diagnosis of diffuse pulmonary meningotheliomatosis (DPM). The final diagnosis was established by surgical biopsy. This article reviews the current literature on DPM, imaging appearance, and an algorithmic approach to the presented case.\n\nrevealed  a  hemodynamically  stable,  well-nourished  woman  in  no apparent  distress.  She  was  afebrile,  with  blood  pressure  of  140/76 mmHg, pulse rate of 106 beats/min, respiratory rate of 10/min, and 97%  oxygen  saturation  on  room  air  at  rest.  Basic  laboratory  tests including  complete  blood  count  and  differential,  electrolytes,  kidney and liver function profiles were normal. Serologic markers were positive for  ANA,  SSA,  however  there  were  no  clinical  signs  or  symptoms  of autoimmune disorder. Microbiological studies were negative for infectious disease. Pulmonary function testing showed lung mechanics suggestive of a restrictive ventilatory defect with an FEV1 of 1.55 L (84%), FVC of 1.89 L (70%), FEV1/FVC ratio of 0.82 and a diffusing capacity for CO2 of 15.70 mL/mmHg/min (79%).\n\nHigh resolution chest CT showed multiple bilateral 2 -4 mm sub-solid (predominantly groundglass) lung nodules (Fig. 1.A -1.B). Some of these nodules were also seen along the fissural surfaces and had a mild predilection  for  the  lower  lobes  and  peripheral  lungs.  There  were  no significantly enlarged lymph nodes, pleural effusions or other abnormalities  in  the  thorax.  No  significant  air  trapping  was  noted  on  the expiratory images. The patient had two abdominal CTs done 1 year and 4 years prior to chest CT, although images were not available for direct comparison.  Reports  of  both  abdominal  CTs  indicated  presence  of ground glass nodules in lower lungs. A diagnostic video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) lung wedge biopsy of right upper and lower lobes was performed for definitive diagnosis.\n\n\u2606 No funding has been received for the conduct of this study and/or preparation of this manuscript.\n\n* Corresponding author at: University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, 200 Lothrop Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA.

Each nodule was composed of a population of bland epithelioid cells forming  small  nests  within  the  interstitium  with  associated  variable amount of fibrosis (Fig. 2.A and 2.B), consistent with DPM. In addition, there  was  patchy  small  airway  abnormality  characterized  by  mild chronic bronchiolitis and prominent peribronchiolar metaplasia (Fig. 2. C).  The  accompanying  interstitium  was  focally  expanded  by  a  mild chronic inflammatory infiltrate (not shown), which did not reach the diagnostic  threshold  of  cellular  interstitial  pneumonia.  Rare  nonnecrotizing  granulomas  were  present  predominantly  in  the  peribronchiolar air spaces (Fig. 2.D).

Discussion\n\nMPMNs were first described as ' chemodectomas ' by Korn et al. in 1960  based  on  their  morphology  and  close  relationship  with  blood vessels  [3].  Later,  immunohistochemical,  ultrastructural  and  fluorescence in situ hybridization studies showed no evidence of neuroendocrine  differentiation  but  rather  found  these  to  be  meningothelial  in origin  [4 -7].  MPMNs  are  benign  often  asymptomatic  and  incidental lesions that are seen on autopsies or surgical lung resections performed for unrelated reasons [8]. MPMNs have been described in the 12 -92 years of age range but are most common in the sixth to seventh decade. A female predominance has been reported with female to male ratio ranging from 1.8:1 to as high as 9:1 [1,3,5,9]. Though often presenting as solitary nodules, MPMNs can rarely be multiple and confined to a lobe or may be distributed diffusely in which case they are called ' DPM ' , a term coined by Suster in 2007 [2]. DPM is usually asymptomatic as well, but can present with respiratory symptoms and mild restrictive lung disease on pulmonary function tests, as seen in our case. The exact etiology  remains  uncertain,  despite  various  studies  reporting  potential associations  with  thromboembolism, smoking-related interstitial lung disease and neoplasm [5,8,10]. Clonal and mutational studies support a reactive rather than neoplastic process for the solitary MPMNs [5,11]. When discovered on imaging studies either incidentally or due to clinical  symptoms,  definitive  diagnosis  requires  surgical  lung  biopsy  or rarely transbronchial biopsy [12 -14]. Management is conservative with surveillance imaging. In the presented case, the patient has remained stable in the 6-month follow-up after VATS biopsy.\n\nImaging approach to a case of diffuse lung nodules requires assessment of the predominant distribution (craniocaudal, central-peripheral and  location  in  the  secondary  pulmonary  lobule)  as  well  as  nodule characteristics. Nodules can be located in a centrilobular, perilymphatic or random distribution. Centrilobular nodules are typically ill defined and ground glass in attenuation (although not exclusively) and spare subpleural and fissural surfaces due to their location in the center of the lobule.  In  the  presented  case,  the  ground  glass  nodules  are  seen  to sporadically  involve  the  subpleural  and  fissural  surfaces  (Fig.  1A) making centrilobular distribution unlikely. Also, lack of propensity for peribronchovascular  or  interlobular  septal  location  rules  out  perilymphatic distribution. Findings are consistent with a random distribution.\n\nGroundglass lung nodules (as seen in this case) can have a wide range of differential diagnoses including respiratory bronchiolitis interstitial lung disease (RB-ILD), hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), vasculitis and infection. However, all these entities pertain to the airways or vessels located  in  the  center  of  the  secondary  pulmonary  lobule  and  hence typically  present  with  centrilobular  distribution  in  contrast  to  the random distribution seen in this case. Additionally, imaging findings of air trapping and upper lung predilection in HP and RB-ILD respectively are not seen in this case. Lack of history of smoking, antigen exposure and clinical features of infection also make RB-ILD, HP and infectious processes unlikely. For randomly distributed nodules, differential diagnostic  considerations  include  metastatic  disease,  and  infectious  processes (miliary pattern). Metastatic disease is excluded as this is usually encountered in the context of a known underlying primary malignancy and the nodules on imaging are discrete and well defined rather than ground glass in attenuation. Miliary tuberculosis or fungal infection is also  unlikely  given  the  clinical  setting  and  chronicity  of  imaging findings.\n\nRadiologic features of DPM described in other studies in literature include randomly distributed ground glass attenuation nodules [1,2,12,15] or discrete micronodules. In our case, micro-nodules were sub-solid  and  predominantly  ground  glass  in  attenuation.  Kraushaar et  al.  have  reported  that  some  DPM  nodules  can  have  a  near-solid appearance through compression of the alveolar airspaces on  microscopic examination [1]. Few authors have also reported nodules with predominantly centrilobular [2] or peripheral predominance [2]. Zonal predominance is variable and has been described as upper lobe [9,15] lower lobe (Fig. 1B) [16] or no zonal predominance [1]. Rarely, some DPM nodules show central cavitation [1], which could be confused for infection inflammatory processes or granulomatous disease. Though a definitive diagnosis on imaging can be difficult to make prospectively, this should be considered in the differential, particularly when findings are  atypical  for  other  processes.  Definitive  diagnosis  requires  tissue confirmation.\n\nThe histologic findings of MPMNs and DPM are similar and both\n\nG. Yun et al.\n\nFig. 2. A.

MPMN can be multiple and mimics DPM histologically, therefore its distinction from  DPM  requires  correlation  with  additional  clinical  information (such as presence of associated respiratory symptoms and/or restrictive ventilatory  defect  on  pulmonary  functional  tests)  and  radiographic findings of diffuse involvement of the pulmonary parenchyma.\n\n## 4. Conclusion\n\nDPM is a rare disease more commonly encountered in women and characterized by randomly distributed micro-nodules. Although these may be clinically innocuous, awareness of this entity is important as it can be confused for other disease processes like metastatic disease, infections  or  interstitial  lung  diseases.  Differentiation  from  metastatic disease can be difficult in patients with historical or concomitant malignancy. Definitive diagnosis requires surgical lung (and rarely transbronchial) biopsy and correlation with additional clinical and radiologic findings.\n\n## References\n\n- [1] Kraushaar G, Ajlan AM, English JC, M\u00fcller NL.
