They are small (1-3 mm) and often multiple. Pathologically, they represent an interstitial nodular proliferation of small oval or spindle-shape cells arranged in a 'zellenballen' nesting pattern. The function and origin of the cells are unknown. These nodules are associated with specific conditions, including thromboembolism, cardiac disease, and malignancy. We describe a patient with MPMNs and adenocarcinoma of the lung in whom HRCT showed tiny (1-3 mm in diameter) nodules of ground-glass attenuation.
