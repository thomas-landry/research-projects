After  careful  selection,  13  paired formalin-fixed tissues from lung carcinoma patients, in-\n\ncluding cell blocks and matched histology samples, were included. PD-L1 expression was assessed using the SP263\n\nassay, and the tumor proportion score (TPS) was evalu- ated.  PD-L1  expression  was  finally  divided  into  three\n\ncategories according to the TPS: &lt; 1% (negative), 1-49%\n\n(low expression) and \u2265 50% (high expression).\n\nResults (if  a  Case  Study  enter  NA):\n\nOf the 13 matched pairs, 12 (92.3%) showed concordant PD-L1 expression.\n\nOn cytology, 3 cases were positive (2 high expressors and\n\n1 low- expressors) of which 2 were concordant and 1 dis- cordant with matched histology specimens. Ten cytology\n\nsamples  were  negative  for  PD-L1  expression,  and  they were  concordant  to  histology  samples.  The  correlation\n\ncoefficient  for  TPS  was  0.75  considered  as  having  good value. Conclusion: With an overall concordance rate of\n\n92.3%  between  cytology  and  histology  specimen,  this study  demonstrates  the  feasibility  of  PD-L1  IHC  with\n\nSP263 clone on limited quality and quantity of cytology samples  from  lung  carcinoma  in  our  institute.  It  is  re-\n\nquired for further evaluation with additional specimens to conclude that the usefulness of cytology cell blocks for\n\nPD-L1 expression analysis.\n\n## Diffuse Pulmonary Meningotheliomatosis: A\u00a0Case Report\n\nM.L.\u00a0Forsythe 1 , O.A.\u00a0Abdelsadek 1 , K.\u00a0Prasai 1 , P.A.\u00a0Raval 1 , S.B.\u00a0Krantz 2 , R.D.\u00a0Shah 3 , J.V .\u00a0Groth 4 ; 1 Pathology, University of Chicago - NorthShore University HealthSystem, Evanston, Illinois, United States, 2 Thoracic Surgery, NorthShore University HealthSystem, Evanston, Illinois, United States, 3 Pulmonary Medicine, NorthShore University HealthSystem, Evanston, Illinois, United States, 4 Pathology, NorthShore University HealthSystem, Evanston, Illinois, United States\n\nIntroduction/Objective: Diffuse pulmonary meningotheliomatosis  (DPM)  is  a  pulmonary  disease characterized by the presence of widespread bilateral minute pulmonary meningothelial-like nodules (MPMNs). It is exceedingly rare and predominantly seen in females. The nodules are typically asymptomatic and detected incidentally on imaging.\n\nMethods/Case  Report: We  present  a  case  of  a  57-yearold woman with a history of chronic cough and CT imaging findings of bilateral multiple ground-glass nodules. Wedge resections  from  the  right  upper  and  right  lower lobes were obtained, which revealed gross changes suggestive of interstitial lung disease. Histologic evaluation of  the  wedges  showed  similar  morphology,  consisting of  discrete  areas  with  variable  interstitial  expansion  of the  stroma  with  ovoid/spindle  cells,  collagen,  elastosis,\n\nand mild chronic inflammatory cells, in a somewhat perivascular pattern. Some areas were also cystic. This appeared in a background of emphysematous change and focal foreign body giant cell reaction to non-polarizable material. Immunohistochemical  stains were diffusely positive for vimentin, EMA , and PR, and CD163 highlighted increased cells that were S100 and CD1a negative. Additionally,  the  ovoid/spindle  cells  were  negative  for desmin, SMM, HMB-45, HHV8, pan-CK, chromogranin, and multiplex SOX10-MART1.\n\nResults (if a Case Study enter NA): NA\n\nConclusion: Diffuse  pulmonary  meningotheliomatosis is a rare entity that requires sufficient histological evaluation  to  identify  the  ovoid/spindle  cell  component histologically and immunohistochemically. This disease should be considered in the differential for cases of  diffuse  interstitial  pulmonary  infiltrates.  Few  cases have  been  reported  in  the  literature,  requiring  further research to understand the mechanisms of this disease and its clinical significance.\n\nLangerhans' Cell Histiocytosis Masquerading as\n\nMetastatic Melanoma on Frozen Section\n\nM.\u00a0Walkenhorst, A.\u00a0Hamza; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Kansas Medical\n\nCenter, Kansas City, Kansas, United States\n\nIntroduction/Objective:\n\nLangerhans'\n\ncell histiocytosis\n\n(LCH)  involving  the  lungs  usually  presents  as  multiple interstitial, bilateral, peribronchiolar pulmonary nodules.\n\nAs  lungs  are  a  common  site  of  metastatic  involvement\n\nLHC can masquerade as a metastatic lesion. The distinc- tion can be challenging, especially on a frozen section.\n\nMethods/Case Report:\n\nWe present a case of a 35-year-old male with history of metastatic melanoma who presented\n\nwith pulmonary nodules and underwent lung wedge re- section. Frozen section was requested at the time of sur-\n\ngery. Grossly there was a 2.8\u00a0cm tan-grey irregular lesion abutting  the  pleura.  Frozen  section  of  a  representative\n\npiece  showed  a  discohesive  lesion  composed  of  large cells with prominent nuclei resembling melanocytes. The\n\neosinophilic  infiltrate  in  the  frozen  slide  was  extremely scant, and presence of anthracotic macrophages resem-\n\nbled the melanin pigment frequently seen with melanoma.\n\nCT imaging prior to the surgery had raised the differen- tial  of  LCH  and  metastatic  disease.  The  frozen  section\n\nwas favored to be negative for carcinoma and metastatic melanoma  and  final  diagnosis  was  deferred  to  perma-\n\nnent  sections.  Permanent  tissue  sections  showed  classic features of LCH and positivity for CD1a confirming the\n\ndiagnosis.\n\nResults (if a Case Study enter NA):\n\nNA\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis case emphasizes the importance of mul- tidisciplinary  approach  and  knowledge  of  imaging  im-\n\npression during a frozen section.\n\nLady Windermere Syndrome: Historical Perspective and\n\nReport of a Rare Case\n\nI.\u00a0Al-kharouf, M.E.\u00a0Abdo, A.\u00a0Hamza; pathology, Kansas university medical center, Kansas City, Missouri, United\n\nStates\n\nIntroduction/Objective:\n\nLady  Windermere  syndrome  re- fers to Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) pulmonary\n\ndisease with an isolated lingular or middle lobe pattern of involvement. This is thought to be due to habitual sup-\n\npression of the cough voluntarily. Typical demographics are that of elderly female patient. Although the etiology\n\nremains  unclear  high  prevalence  of  pectus  excavatum, scoliosis and mitral valve prolapse has also been noted in\n\nthese patients. The purpose of this report this to describe a case of this syndrome.\n\nMethods/Case Report:\n\nA 64-year-old female with a his- tory of breast carcinoma status post bilateral mastecto-\n\nmies, and thyroid papillary microcarcinoma, status post thyroidectomy, presented with hemoptysis. Clinically and\n\nradiological  findings  were  consistent  with  pneumonia which improved but did not completely resolve following\n\nantibiotic treatment. Computerized tomography (CT) re- vealed progressive infiltrates and bronchoscopy cultures\n\ngrew Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). Repeat an- tibiotic  therapy  resulted  in  only  marginal  improvement.\n\nRepeat  CT  showed  diffuse  bronchiectatic  changes  with scattered nodularity and tree-in-bud opacities, with ma-\n\njority of involvement in the right middle lobe and lingula.\n\nMultiple interventions were employed to ameliorate the patient's  condition  including  a  positive  expiratory  pres-\n\nsure device, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) pre- cautions and combinations of 2 drug therapies without\n\nsignificant  improvement  in  her  condition.  It  was  ulti- mately decided that she may benefit from a right middle\n\nlobectomy. Histologic sections from the lobectomy spec- imen showed necrotizing and non-necrotizing granulom-\n\natous inflammation and bronchiolectasis. Rare acid-fast microorganisms  were  identified  on  AFB  special  satin.\n\nLady Windermere syndrome was suggested in the diag- nostic comment after expert consultation. Patient's symp-\n\ntoms improved after surgery and additional samples show no growth of MAC.\n\nResults (if a Case Study enter NA):\n\nConclusion:\n\nNA\n\nAlthough  rendering  a  definite  diagnosis  is challenging in such cases, the constellation of clinical, ra-\n\ndiologic, and histologic finding can be used to raise the possibility of Lady Windermere syndrome.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## First and Only FDA Cleared Digital Cytology System\n\nGenius\u2122 Cervical AI\n\nGenius\u2122 Review Station\n\nGenius\u2122 Digital Imager\n\n## Empower Your Genius With Ours\n\nMake a Greater Impact on Cervical Cancer with the Advanced Technology of the Genius\u2122 Digital Diagnostics System\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nADS-04159-001 Rev 001 \u00a9 2024 Hologic, Inc.
