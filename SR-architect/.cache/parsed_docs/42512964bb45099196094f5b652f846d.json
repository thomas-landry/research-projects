Hence the patient was male and symptomatic; further evaluation was needed. Bronchoscopy was nondiagnostic which led to a diagnostic surgical procedure. The patient underwent diagnostic right lower lobe and middle lobe wedge resections. Histopathological examination revealed diffuse meningotheliomatosis unexpectedly. When HRCT findings were reviewed, micronodules smaller than 1 mm were identified. Although the patient only received symptomatic treatment, there were no changes in thorax CT findings through the three years follow up.",
